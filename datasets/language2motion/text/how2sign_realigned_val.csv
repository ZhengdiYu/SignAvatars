-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_0	-d5dN54tH2E_0-1-rgb_front	12.97	19.52	We're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_1	-d5dN54tH2E_1-1-rgb_front	20.65	24.28	I call it painting the wall.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_10	-d5dN54tH2E_10-1-rgb_front	85.5	87.83	So we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_11	-d5dN54tH2E_11-1-rgb_front	87.84	93.62	And just let those fingers relax.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_12	-d5dN54tH2E_12-1-rgb_front	94.26	101.39	Now together you're going to go opposite.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_13	-d5dN54tH2E_13-1-rgb_front	102.15	110.04	Do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_14	-d5dN54tH2E_14-1-rgb_front	111.88	116.02	It's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_15	-d5dN54tH2E_15-1-rgb_front	116.02	120.82	Let the wrist do all the leading.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_2	-d5dN54tH2E_2-1-rgb_front	26.03	36.99	So this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_3	-d5dN54tH2E_3-1-rgb_front	37.0	45.84	So basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_4	-d5dN54tH2E_4-1-rgb_front	45.84	53.8	Don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_5	-d5dN54tH2E_5-1-rgb_front	30.45	33.26	Let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_6	-d5dN54tH2E_6-1-rgb_front	54.0	64.33	Our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_7	-d5dN54tH2E_7-1-rgb_front	64.81	68.31	So let's start with the one hand going up and down.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_8	-d5dN54tH2E_8-1-rgb_front	68.32	71.3	We're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E-1-rgb_front	-d5dN54tH2E_9	-d5dN54tH2E_9-1-rgb_front	77.05	84.4	You want it right in front of your solar plexus.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_0	-f1_kdl050s_0-1-rgb_front	1.96	7.58	In this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_1	-f1_kdl050s_1-1-rgb_front	8.09	11.55	The number one loss for these birds, is flight.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_10	-f1_kdl050s_10-1-rgb_front	56.94	60.48	You need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_11	-f1_kdl050s_11-1-rgb_front	60.49	64.73	It seems to be the number one way to loose them.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_12	-f1_kdl050s_12-1-rgb_front	64.76	66.71	Once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_13	-f1_kdl050s_13-1-rgb_front	66.71	75.82	These guys are not suited to live in the United States, they are not native here and they don't survive.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_14	-f1_kdl050s_14-1-rgb_front	76.2	81.22	The other dangers you need to worry about, is Teflon pans.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_15	-f1_kdl050s_15-1-rgb_front	81.22	90.39	If they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_16	-f1_kdl050s_16-1-rgb_front	90.74	93.72	There is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_17	-f1_kdl050s_17-1-rgb_front	93.9	100.54	It is kind of a silent killer.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_18	-f1_kdl050s_18-1-rgb_front	101.65	106.86	So, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with Teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_19	-f1_kdl050s_19-1-rgb_front	106.88	124.34	Aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_2	-f1_kdl050s_2-1-rgb_front	11.55	18.81	If these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_20	-f1_kdl050s_20-1-rgb_front	125.37	130.88	And, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_21	-f1_kdl050s_21-1-rgb_front	131.27	132.41	So you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_22	-f1_kdl050s_22-1-rgb_front	134.64	154.09	And lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_23	-f1_kdl050s_23-1-rgb_front	155.27	165.75	There is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_24	-f1_kdl050s_24-1-rgb_front	166.28	168.03	You have to be fairly careful with these birds.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_25	-f1_kdl050s_25-1-rgb_front	168.03	171.85	At least in a physical way.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_26	-f1_kdl050s_26-1-rgb_front	125.9	129.17	Those are most of your household dangers.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_27	-f1_kdl050s_27-1-rgb_front	173.54	179.62	And again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_28	-f1_kdl050s_28-1-rgb_front	179.62	184.53	You don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_29	-f1_kdl050s_29-1-rgb_front	184.53	193.65	Just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_3	-f1_kdl050s_3-1-rgb_front	19.41	25.22	A lot of these birds aren't tame.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_30	-f1_kdl050s_30-1-rgb_front	193.65	199.42	You make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_31	-f1_kdl050s_31-1-rgb_front	200.13	213.7	And, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_32	-f1_kdl050s_32-1-rgb_front	213.7	218.55	Like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_33	-f1_kdl050s_33-1-rgb_front	219.42	233.54	And, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_34	-f1_kdl050s_34-1-rgb_front	234.27	239.64	So you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_35	-f1_kdl050s_35-1-rgb_front	241.11	247.5	That more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_4	-f1_kdl050s_4-1-rgb_front	15.8	17.69	People get them and they only have two or three of them.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_5	-f1_kdl050s_5-1-rgb_front	26.52	32.3	As you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_6	-f1_kdl050s_6-1-rgb_front	32.3	35.98	And when they panic, they fly and they don't come back.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_7	-f1_kdl050s_7-1-rgb_front	36.03	37.79	They fly out your windows.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_8	-f1_kdl050s_8-1-rgb_front	36.03	37.79	They fly out your front door.
-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s-1-rgb_front	-f1_kdl050s_9	-f1_kdl050s_9-1-rgb_front	41.18	53.61	You will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1	00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1-1-rgb_front	0.6	36.6	I hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. Now, circle hooks has been used by Japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_2	00dWJ4YRRSI_2-1-rgb_front	37.05	44.77	This hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_3	00dWJ4YRRSI_3-1-rgb_front	45.53	53.1	Now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_4	00dWJ4YRRSI_4-1-rgb_front	53.44	74.85	You basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_5	00dWJ4YRRSI_5-1-rgb_front	75.66	94.26	Once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_6	00dWJ4YRRSI_6-1-rgb_front	95.45	101.39	The nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_7	00dWJ4YRRSI_7-1-rgb_front	74.78	76.23	You don't damage a lot of fish.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_8	00dWJ4YRRSI_8-1-rgb_front	102.53	106.73	You simply get him up to the boat.
00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI-1-rgb_front	00dWJ4YRRSI_9	00dWJ4YRRSI_9-1-rgb_front	107.17	114.43	If you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_0	0oGfy530AuI_0-1-rgb_front	0.92	2.86	MICHAEL ROSENGART: Thrusters.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_1	0oGfy530AuI_1-1-rgb_front	3.15	7.54	Right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_10	0oGfy530AuI_10-1-rgb_front	42.29	44.75	Jonesy is going to sit back.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_11	0oGfy530AuI_11-1-rgb_front	44.75	53.44	And as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_12	0oGfy530AuI_12-1-rgb_front	54.62	55.41	Good.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_13	0oGfy530AuI_13-1-rgb_front	56.53	61.21	And then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_14	0oGfy530AuI_14-1-rgb_front	61.21	67.11	Not out to the side, not back, but right above.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_15	0oGfy530AuI_15-1-rgb_front	67.44	68.26	That's good.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_16	0oGfy530AuI_16-1-rgb_front	68.26	70.54	Good work, Jonesy.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_17	0oGfy530AuI_17-1-rgb_front	70.77	83.04	Again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_18	0oGfy530AuI_18-1-rgb_front	83.04	92.44	Do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_19	0oGfy530AuI_19-1-rgb_front	92.45	104.73	Again, I want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_2	0oGfy530AuI_2-1-rgb_front	8.14	11.88	We're integrating more of the body.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_20	0oGfy530AuI_20-1-rgb_front	104.73	105.66	It's not segmented.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_21	0oGfy530AuI_21-1-rgb_front	105.66	106.79	It's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_22	0oGfy530AuI_22-1-rgb_front	106.79	111.52	It's one smooth movement.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_23	0oGfy530AuI_23-1-rgb_front	111.53	112.31	Try it.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_3	0oGfy530AuI_3-1-rgb_front	12.5	21.83	And we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_4	0oGfy530AuI_4-1-rgb_front	15.72	15.99	Okay.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_5	0oGfy530AuI_5-1-rgb_front	23.03	26.64	So, Jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_6	0oGfy530AuI_6-1-rgb_front	26.64	31.89	Jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_7	0oGfy530AuI_7-1-rgb_front	31.89	36.92	And we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat.
0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI-1-rgb_front	0oGfy530AuI_8	0oGfy530AuI_8-1-rgb_front	36.92	41.38	And we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple.

1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_1	1-xK5UtDSmE_1-2-rgb_front	24.9	33.06	We've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results.

1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_11	1-xK5UtDSmE_11-2-rgb_front	118.23	129.41	And you know when we got to that, I said, you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_12	1-xK5UtDSmE_12-2-rgb_front	129.41	149.47	And I said, you know like ice cream, ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time, it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect, and the president said whoa, you can't go there, that's my favorite food.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_13	1-xK5UtDSmE_13-2-rgb_front	149.5	159.31	And so then I said well, maybe soda would be something that you would start with as.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_14	1-xK5UtDSmE_14-2-rgb_front	159.32	167.41	And he said whoa wait, the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_15	1-xK5UtDSmE_15-2-rgb_front	168.02	180.93	And so the net after our presentation I called back and I wasn't getting any callbacks.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_16	1-xK5UtDSmE_16-2-rgb_front	180.93	186.8	We want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead.

1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_18	1-xK5UtDSmE_18-2-rgb_front	194.51	208.48	So I speak to you Mr. CEO, Mr. corporate owner, Mr. corporate president, you that are trying to produce something positive in your company, you need to pay attention to your own health.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_19	1-xK5UtDSmE_19-2-rgb_front	211.25	222.93	Think about it, if you have a heart attack, if you are hit with cancer, what is that going to do to your organization?

1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_3	1-xK5UtDSmE_3-2-rgb_front	46.76	53.69	Well if you are not healthy, can you have a healthy organization?

1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_6	1-xK5UtDSmE_6-2-rgb_front	79.28	90.01	And so we started talking about it and I said to him, well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_7	1-xK5UtDSmE_7-2-rgb_front	94.88	99.3	And I said well one of them would be exercise.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_8	1-xK5UtDSmE_8-2-rgb_front	99.3	105.8	You are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise.
1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE-2-rgb_front	1-xK5UtDSmE_9	1-xK5UtDSmE_9-2-rgb_front	105.8	111.73	Another one is drinking water, we're going to get into these in a little more detail.

11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_1	11JT4jRNI-o_1-2-rgb_front	7.75	9.43	Again, so many variations.

11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_11	11JT4jRNI-o_11-2-rgb_front	55.78	69.66	If you're tubing is really tight, you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together.
11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_12	11JT4jRNI-o_12-2-rgb_front	69.72	73.13	A squat position, close together, doesn't work very well.

11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_14	11JT4jRNI-o_14-2-rgb_front	88.1	91.46	But it's definitely a great exercise, and I highly recommend it.
11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_2	11JT4jRNI-o_2-2-rgb_front	7.27	9.65	I'm going to show you something simple and basic.
11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_3	11JT4jRNI-o_3-2-rgb_front	10.37	16.11	I've got my feet about shoulder width apart, pretty much have to, to do a descent squat.
11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o-2-rgb_front	11JT4jRNI-o_4	11JT4jRNI-o_4-2-rgb_front	16.57	23.54	I'm going to take my tubing up, and I'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward.

1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_1	1G8LIWgKLME_1-2-rgb_front	9.29	18.01	A stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large.
1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_2	1G8LIWgKLME_2-2-rgb_front	18.14	23.45	There's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do.
1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_3	1G8LIWgKLME_3-2-rgb_front	24.58	42.41	"For a very small intricate design like an ""i"" you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you're wanting to do something large such as the sun you're going to want to use the largest end that you have."
1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_4	1G8LIWgKLME_4-2-rgb_front	42.55	52.7	There's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that.
1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_5	1G8LIWgKLME_5-2-rgb_front	52.79	59.81	For your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting.
1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME-2-rgb_front	1G8LIWgKLME_6	1G8LIWgKLME_6-2-rgb_front	59.93	75.3	I prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen.

1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front	1QmgK8f5JnY_2	1QmgK8f5JnY_2-1-rgb_front	38.77	65.16	So, having said that, when you're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center, or a wellness center, something of that nature, and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there.
1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front	1QmgK8f5JnY_3	1QmgK8f5JnY_3-1-rgb_front	65.17	71.9	You always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist.
1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY-1-rgb_front	1QmgK8f5JnY_4	1QmgK8f5JnY_4-1-rgb_front	78.13	104.62	You can check with local networks, newspapers, other massage therapists in the area, for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews.

1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front	1V-aOg8wCT4_6	1V-aOg8wCT4_6-1-rgb_front	29.63	36.85	Now, depending on the size of the sponsorship, you can offer quarter page, half page, or full-page ads.
1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4-1-rgb_front	1V-aOg8wCT4_7	1V-aOg8wCT4_7-1-rgb_front	37.3	43.78	Title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program.

1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_13	1aJwX9nRlmk_13-2-rgb_front	118.98	127.14	Stick with your 3-part breath into the belly, into the ribcage, and then into the heart.
1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_14	1aJwX9nRlmk_14-2-rgb_front	127.21	135.47	Then as you inhale, you're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder.

1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_18	1aJwX9nRlmk_18-2-rgb_front	153.43	173.91	Now, slowly begin to connect these movements, exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades, and do this as long as you're comfortable.
1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_19	1aJwX9nRlmk_19-2-rgb_front	173.91	177.12	I'd say at least 20 repetitions.

1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_5	1aJwX9nRlmk_5-2-rgb_front	53.12	60.77	You're going to inhale, and then as you exhale, just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder.
1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk-2-rgb_front	1aJwX9nRlmk_6	1aJwX9nRlmk_6-2-rgb_front	60.77	68.71	Notice how my shoulders don't creep up--[SOUNDS LIKE] errk--as I drop the ear down, right?

279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_1	279MO2nwC_E_1-2-rgb_front	8.15	13.28	In this section we are going to talk about full body movement.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_10	279MO2nwC_E_10-2-rgb_front	101.75	108.52	So you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_2	279MO2nwC_E_2-2-rgb_front	13.91	21.14	So what I mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_3	279MO2nwC_E_3-2-rgb_front	21.37	31.48	Your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy, I know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms, but you should really be moving your arms.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_4	279MO2nwC_E_4-2-rgb_front	31.66	56.78	And the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot, especially when the intensity increases, and let's say you come to that hill, you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body, and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs, and you are breathing in that fresh air, and blowing it back out with full body movement.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_5	279MO2nwC_E_5-2-rgb_front	56.88	67.11	Now as far as your lower body, your legs, you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_6	279MO2nwC_E_6-2-rgb_front	67.16	76.77	So you see if I was running, as I am running I am putting most of the weight on my calves and I am moving my body and I am moving my arms and my shoulders.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_7	279MO2nwC_E_7-2-rgb_front	76.84	83.04	And breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_8	279MO2nwC_E_8-2-rgb_front	83.13	88.6	And will you notice the difference the next time you run, just remember in your mind what I said.
279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E-2-rgb_front	279MO2nwC_E_9	279MO2nwC_E_9-2-rgb_front	88.79	101.59	The more that you move your arms, you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_1	2SnVWW3MOB4_1-2-rgb_front	5.18	11.49	We are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_2	2SnVWW3MOB4_2-2-rgb_front	11.5	22.56	You want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_3	2SnVWW3MOB4_3-2-rgb_front	22.64	28.5	Probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_4	2SnVWW3MOB4_4-2-rgb_front	28.51	46.77	Diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_5	2SnVWW3MOB4_5-2-rgb_front	46.87	55.03	Avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides.
2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4-2-rgb_front	2SnVWW3MOB4_6	2SnVWW3MOB4_6-2-rgb_front	55.31	79.62	You can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_0	2ri5HYm48MA_0-2-rgb_front	0.65	1.33	REBECCA SATO: Hi.

2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_11	2ri5HYm48MA_11-2-rgb_front	82.33	96.67	And what they do is every time they're writing from that character's perspective or about that character, they will think what would that person that I know do, how would they react, how would they sound, how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_12	2ri5HYm48MA_12-2-rgb_front	96.67	105.74	And what's nice is that it's not someone that you know super well and so there's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which, I think, is very important and we should let it do that.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_13	2ri5HYm48MA_13-2-rgb_front	105.74	116.69	So basically, you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don't know him so well that it takes away their wonder.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_14	2ri5HYm48MA_14-2-rgb_front	116.69	121.64	So try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with, a really great framework.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_2	2ri5HYm48MA_2-2-rgb_front	3.48	9.17	And we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_3	2ri5HYm48MA_3-2-rgb_front	9.47	16.25	And it doesn't matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them, preferably a little of everything.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_4	2ri5HYm48MA_4-2-rgb_front	16.35	26.85	Not necessarily with the same character, that will be a little conflicted, but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_5	2ri5HYm48MA_5-2-rgb_front	26.98	43.74	And right now, I'm talking primarily about stories whether it's short stories or novels, but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you're writing a storyboard for a commercial.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_6	2ri5HYm48MA_6-2-rgb_front	43.8	46.22	I mean, you still want to know how to develop good characters.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_7	2ri5HYm48MA_7-2-rgb_front	46.71	52.29	But primarily, I'll be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_8	2ri5HYm48MA_8-2-rgb_front	52.8	67.8	So one thing that I find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have mentioned--and these are writers who are rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them--is to develop a really great character.
2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA-2-rgb_front	2ri5HYm48MA_9	2ri5HYm48MA_9-2-rgb_front	67.8	72.04	It helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_1	2yudAtTnZrg_1-1-rgb_front	9.18	14.17	Now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_10	2yudAtTnZrg_10-1-rgb_front	70.45	80.65	Now this is, you just don't put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_11	2yudAtTnZrg_11-1-rgb_front	80.8	86.18	Let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_12	2yudAtTnZrg_12-1-rgb_front	86.95	91.05	Just gradually do it.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_13	2yudAtTnZrg_13-1-rgb_front	92.38	97.61	Maybe a couple of cups at a time.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_2	2yudAtTnZrg_2-1-rgb_front	15.17	24.92	Like I said, if you still have a little Crisco and it is floating around it is okay.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_3	2yudAtTnZrg_3-1-rgb_front	25.54	41.05	At this time I'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_4	2yudAtTnZrg_4-1-rgb_front	43.09	46.47	It is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_5	2yudAtTnZrg_5-1-rgb_front	46.66	47.18	Let me see.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_6	2yudAtTnZrg_6-1-rgb_front	47.3	50.36	Let's get the glasses.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_7	2yudAtTnZrg_7-1-rgb_front	51.23	55.79	Let me see if I have, I only have 4 in there.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_8	2yudAtTnZrg_8-1-rgb_front	56.08	58.79	Let me add some more.
2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg-1-rgb_front	2yudAtTnZrg_9	2yudAtTnZrg_9-1-rgb_front	59.1	61.11	Okay I have my 6 cups.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_0	33YRZ5UZTA4_0-2-rgb_front	0.39	1.51	JASON PAINTER: Hi, I'm Jason.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_1	33YRZ5UZTA4_1-2-rgb_front	1.66	5.06	Today, we're painting on glass.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_10	33YRZ5UZTA4_10-2-rgb_front	79.51	81.27	Fill that in, just like that.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_11	33YRZ5UZTA4_11-2-rgb_front	81.36	85.22	We don't have to do anything anymore.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_12	33YRZ5UZTA4_12-2-rgb_front	85.47	87.52	We'll be defeating the purpose.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_13	33YRZ5UZTA4_13-2-rgb_front	87.64	91.9	We'll just spread that paint out thinner and thinner, and just be frustrated in the end.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_14	33YRZ5UZTA4_14-2-rgb_front	92.04	94.68	So, this line here is not touching.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_15	33YRZ5UZTA4_15-2-rgb_front	94.88	100.59	We can just put a little dab of black there, same as up here.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_16	33YRZ5UZTA4_16-2-rgb_front	100.83	118.27	Just, basically, just want everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_17	33YRZ5UZTA4_17-2-rgb_front	118.35	128.74	So, go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in, and look at it, and we'll wait for that to dry.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_18	33YRZ5UZTA4_18-2-rgb_front	128.89	130.94	And touch up the white.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_2	33YRZ5UZTA4_2-2-rgb_front	5.11	11.51	We have put the first coat, the liner, and the fill in on all three of the steps.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_3	33YRZ5UZTA4_3-2-rgb_front	11.95	20.46	It's looking like it's ready now to be--we can really start touching up the liner.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_4	33YRZ5UZTA4_4-2-rgb_front	20.62	23.05	We can really start touching up the black.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_5	33YRZ5UZTA4_5-2-rgb_front	23.33	39.61	If we look at it, we can see spots that-that filled in and spots that didn't, and we don't have to worry about how these thick line--it really looks bad right now, but we're just in the beginning stages.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_6	33YRZ5UZTA4_6-2-rgb_front	39.59	49.64	So, really, those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect, everywhere that we know they're going to need to, and all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to need to.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_7	33YRZ5UZTA4_7-2-rgb_front	50.2	70.0	So, we just take the angle brush back again, get black back out, and really, the less paint you have on here, the better, just a very little on the tip of your brush.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_8	33YRZ5UZTA4_8-2-rgb_front	70.08	77.64	This line right here needs to be filled in, and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes.
33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4-2-rgb_front	33YRZ5UZTA4_9	33YRZ5UZTA4_9-2-rgb_front	77.71	79.39	We're just going to set the paint right on it.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_0	33jxeIIbBnM_0-1-rgb_front	1.48	4.28	Hi, my name is Dave Andrews.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_1	33jxeIIbBnM_1-1-rgb_front	4.5	11.18	Today, I'm going to show you how to run a macro in Excel from Access.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_10	33jxeIIbBnM_10-1-rgb_front	69.96	72.45	Click on your office button.

33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_12	33jxeIIbBnM_12-1-rgb_front	74.5	77.38	We're going to save macro enable workbook.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_13	33jxeIIbBnM_13-1-rgb_front	77.71	80.22	Let's name it book one and just say save.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_14	33jxeIIbBnM_14-1-rgb_front	80.99	98.79	Now, we need to go into Access by clicking the start button, all programs, Microsoft Office.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_15	33jxeIIbBnM_15-1-rgb_front	99.68	100.57	Let's open Access.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_16	33jxeIIbBnM_16-1-rgb_front	100.79	115.38	We need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_17	33jxeIIbBnM_17-1-rgb_front	116.11	120.75	Let's leave the name as database one and say create.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_18	33jxeIIbBnM_18-1-rgb_front	120.81	122.81	Here's our new database.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_19	33jxeIIbBnM_19-1-rgb_front	123.13	134.18	To run that macro from Excel macro from Access, hold down the ALT key on the keyboard.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_2	33jxeIIbBnM_2-1-rgb_front	11.25	13.25	Let's begin by opening up Excel.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_20	33jxeIIbBnM_20-1-rgb_front	134.25	135.78	Press F11.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_21	33jxeIIbBnM_21-1-rgb_front	136.11	142.58	This brings up the visual basic code editor.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_22	33jxeIIbBnM_22-1-rgb_front	143.1	144.44	Go to the top.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_23	33jxeIIbBnM_23-1-rgb_front	144.64	147.47	Say insert.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_24	33jxeIIbBnM_24-1-rgb_front	147.92	150.7	We're going to say module.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_25	33jxeIIbBnM_25-1-rgb_front	151.82	154.57	In our code editor, we're going to begin typing in some code.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_26	33jxeIIbBnM_26-1-rgb_front	155.46	162.68	Now that we have our function created in Access, I'm going to go over it with you real quick.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_27	33jxeIIbBnM_27-1-rgb_front	163.23	174.9	First thing it does is it creates a variable called Excel and the sign says Excel value.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_28	33jxeIIbBnM_28-1-rgb_front	175.24	182.57	To the create object function, it launches a new Excel dot application scheme.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_29	33jxeIIbBnM_29-1-rgb_front	182.69	202.48	It then opens up a Excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that I typed in and then it simply says Excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_3	33jxeIIbBnM_3-1-rgb_front	13.43	19.97	Let's first create our macro by clicking the view tab.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_30	33jxeIIbBnM_30-1-rgb_front	203.4	210.84	You then could link to this function Excel test within an object in your database.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_31	33jxeIIbBnM_31-1-rgb_front	211.12	223.86	My name is Dave Andrews and I just showed you how to run an Excel macro from Access.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_4	33jxeIIbBnM_4-1-rgb_front	21.08	25.64	Go into macros and saying record macro.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_5	33jxeIIbBnM_5-1-rgb_front	26.08	33.75	We're going to name this macro one just say okay.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_6	33jxeIIbBnM_6-1-rgb_front	34.27	42.41	All this macro is going to do is type the number one, two, three, four across the top row.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_7	33jxeIIbBnM_7-1-rgb_front	43.3	56.16	So, let's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_8	33jxeIIbBnM_8-1-rgb_front	56.47	59.39	Now, we have our macro created.
33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM-1-rgb_front	33jxeIIbBnM_9	33jxeIIbBnM_9-1-rgb_front	59.82	66.49	So, let's save this as a macro enable workbook.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_0	39FN42e41r0_0-1-rgb_front	0.11	9.94	MICHAEL ROSENGART: Right now, I'm here with two personal trainers, Ryan Regensburg and Jonesy and we're doing some renegade rows.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_1	39FN42e41r0_1-1-rgb_front	10.22	19.65	So, what I want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands, whereas Ryan's going to show us later on a little variation for it.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_10	39FN42e41r0_10-1-rgb_front	61.13	64.56	So, basically, he's just going to work one side at a time.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_11	39FN42e41r0_11-1-rgb_front	65.11	69.84	The hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_12	39FN42e41r0_12-1-rgb_front	70.55	72.93	And then once he does five, he's just going to switch over to the other side.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_13	39FN42e41r0_13-1-rgb_front	73.09	85.26	Again, for this workout, we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that I want you to work on or consider if you can do it, is a push up renegade row like Jonesy's doing here.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_14	39FN42e41r0_14-1-rgb_front	86.08	95.34	Each time you're going down, you're going to do a push up and then come back up.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_15	39FN42e41r0_15-1-rgb_front	95.98	108.89	It helps for a couple of different reasons, it helps again, to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up--stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_16	39FN42e41r0_16-1-rgb_front	109.24	109.81	Alright.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_17	39FN42e41r0_17-1-rgb_front	109.89	110.58	Good.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_18	39FN42e41r0_18-1-rgb_front	111.37	120.64	And then once you've done with fifteen or twenty reps, grab some water, meet us on the next exercise in the next clip.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_2	39FN42e41r0_2-1-rgb_front	19.91	22.82	Jonesy's here in a push up position.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_3	39FN42e41r0_3-1-rgb_front	23.66	30.28	And what you're going to do is you're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage, shifting your weight back and forth.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_4	39FN42e41r0_4-1-rgb_front	30.6	34.77	Now, if you're just starting on this, you may want to work with really wide feet.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_5	39FN42e41r0_5-1-rgb_front	34.86	39.61	That will give you more balance and support as you perform, alright?
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_6	39FN42e41r0_6-1-rgb_front	39.93	44.56	At the same time, if you want a little bit more of a challenge, bring your feet closer together as you work.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_7	39FN42e41r0_7-1-rgb_front	45.47	52.88	Exhale as you pull up and you're going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_8	39FN42e41r0_8-1-rgb_front	53.14	55.12	Ryan, go ahead and get down.
39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0-1-rgb_front	39FN42e41r0_9	39FN42e41r0_9-1-rgb_front	56.02	60.15	And Ryan's going to do a one-handed renegade row.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_0	3EjKvwck6ss_0-1-rgb_front	1.06	9.67	Now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub-sections, what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_1	3EjKvwck6ss_1-1-rgb_front	10.57	19.36	What I like to do first is I like to heat the hair up just a little bit, especially just on the ends.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_10	3EjKvwck6ss_10-1-rgb_front	56.87	58.73	Does it make the shine stay more?
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_11	3EjKvwck6ss_11-1-rgb_front	58.83	59.97	It does.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_12	3EjKvwck6ss_12-1-rgb_front	60.63	70.1	Basically what I do by heating up the hair, and you'll notice when you put it in, it kind of melts in your hair.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_13	3EjKvwck6ss_13-1-rgb_front	70.12	71.24	It's like putting butter.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_14	3EjKvwck6ss_14-1-rgb_front	72.53	77.1	When you heat up butter, butter is going to spread better, so basically that's what this is.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_15	3EjKvwck6ss_15-1-rgb_front	56.09	57.16	It's like spreading butter.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_16	3EjKvwck6ss_16-1-rgb_front	77.89	80.44	Does it help with the dryness?
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_17	3EjKvwck6ss_17-1-rgb_front	80.73	83.35	It's not going to help with the dryness.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_18	3EjKvwck6ss_18-1-rgb_front	83.7	90.56	The moisturizing conditioner is what's going to help with the dryness of your hair.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_19	3EjKvwck6ss_19-1-rgb_front	91.27	97.79	What this is going to do is just help to keep its shape, what we're going for.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_2	3EjKvwck6ss_2-1-rgb_front	12.34	14.92	We're just going to heat up the hair.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_20	3EjKvwck6ss_20-1-rgb_front	98.7	109.13	It's pliable and it's fibrous, and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_21	3EjKvwck6ss_21-1-rgb_front	110.02	114.26	Heat it up in your palms and just pull it through.

3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_3	3EjKvwck6ss_3-1-rgb_front	20.18	25.24	Then what I like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_4	3EjKvwck6ss_4-1-rgb_front	25.58	32.79	A lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_5	3EjKvwck6ss_5-1-rgb_front	34.99	39.56	I like to think about it as getting your car painted.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_6	3EjKvwck6ss_6-1-rgb_front	39.82	42.03	Do you know what they do before they paint your car?
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_7	3EjKvwck6ss_7-1-rgb_front	42.38	43.64	They prime it.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_8	3EjKvwck6ss_8-1-rgb_front	44.82	51.99	Basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color.
3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss-1-rgb_front	3EjKvwck6ss_9	3EjKvwck6ss_9-1-rgb_front	52.62	53.67	In this case, hairspray.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_0	3HCjTYIijec_0-2-rgb_front	0.46	5.37	Urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_1	3HCjTYIijec_1-2-rgb_front	5.6	18.56	Well, what are the unwritten rules for women about dating.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_10_11	3HCjTYIijec_10_11-2-rgb_front	107.89	119.22	They're no more successful than you are. The probability is you're more successful They may have their own agenda as well.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_12	3HCjTYIijec_12-2-rgb_front	119.98	131.93	So, I would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_13	3HCjTYIijec_13-2-rgb_front	132.02	133.65	That's what it's all about.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_14	3HCjTYIijec_14-2-rgb_front	133.77	135.18	This is Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_15	3HCjTYIijec_15-2-rgb_front	135.59	140.9	May your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_2	3HCjTYIijec_2-2-rgb_front	18.65	31.15	This is Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_3	3HCjTYIijec_3-2-rgb_front	31.3	36.83	If they're unwritten, then how do we know them?
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_4	3HCjTYIijec_4-2-rgb_front	37.56	45.66	Well, they're passed on, and the best thing I can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman, as a woman, to give you valid information.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_5	3HCjTYIijec_5-2-rgb_front	52.76	72.15	Guess what, ladies, they're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are, and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_6	3HCjTYIijec_6-2-rgb_front	72.29	75.02	It's a vicious cycle.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_7	3HCjTYIijec_7-2-rgb_front	75.64	85.9	If you have questions, as I often say, if you want to find out about a man, why ask a woman, ask a man, ask Dr. Paul.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_8	3HCjTYIijec_8-2-rgb_front	85.93	96.38	If you're at the point, where you're asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input, then you're doing the wrong thing.
3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec-2-rgb_front	3HCjTYIijec_9	3HCjTYIijec_9-2-rgb_front	96.44	107.71	So, the unwritten beliefs that you're going to get, that data that you need, from your girl friends, is totally, absolutely, unequivocally wrong.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_0	3TrMyzNWGpY_0-2-rgb_front	0.83	8.45	Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_1	3TrMyzNWGpY_1-2-rgb_front	8.57	12.35	How do you practice your kickboxing moves?
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_10	3TrMyzNWGpY_10-2-rgb_front	99.87	118.84	Every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent, come in, engage, and then clear step out, re-open the gap with a clearing technique, I like to clear with a jab or I'll clear with the front leg round kick.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_11	3TrMyzNWGpY_11-2-rgb_front	119.01	134.92	So I engage, step in, fire, fire, fire, clear and then here is the biggy, change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_12	3TrMyzNWGpY_12-2-rgb_front	135.33	159.42	So we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time, two, every attack penetrating footwork, engage, clearing footwork, change your alignment that's always the pattern.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_13	3TrMyzNWGpY_13-2-rgb_front	159.69	166.24	Penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment, penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_14	3TrMyzNWGpY_14-2-rgb_front	166.32	177.83	Make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_15	3TrMyzNWGpY_15-2-rgb_front	178.08	179.74	I'm John Graden.

3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_3	3TrMyzNWGpY_3-2-rgb_front	9.11	11.11	As a kickboxer this is one I'm particularly fond of.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_4	3TrMyzNWGpY_4-2-rgb_front	16.08	23.74	Here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_5	3TrMyzNWGpY_5-2-rgb_front	24.6	33.3	If I am hitting the bag or I'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_6	3TrMyzNWGpY_6-2-rgb_front	33.33	52.07	They'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one, you waste a lot of energy, two, you tense the body up, three you tend to run out of gas faster.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_7	3TrMyzNWGpY_7-2-rgb_front	52.34	59.84	You don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that?
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_8	3TrMyzNWGpY_8-2-rgb_front	59.97	75.41	I'll have techniques that I'm just going to snap and I'm just going to pop out there so I might go snap, snap, snap, snap, snap and about every seventh or eight go pow, pow, pow, pow, pow and then I recover.
3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY-2-rgb_front	3TrMyzNWGpY_9	3TrMyzNWGpY_9-2-rgb_front	75.5	99.78	Pow, pow, pow, pow so I'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques, two, every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you're penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole.
3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front	3sZjSNcqXpI_1	3sZjSNcqXpI_1-1-rgb_front	11.78	32.02	Now depending on your style of play, if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field.
3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front	3sZjSNcqXpI_2	3sZjSNcqXpI_2-1-rgb_front	32.17	45.23	If you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward.
3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front	3sZjSNcqXpI_3	3sZjSNcqXpI_3-1-rgb_front	45.49	56.8	Now if defense isn't your thing and you like to play more offense, when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense.
3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front	3sZjSNcqXpI_4	3sZjSNcqXpI_4-1-rgb_front	57.61	69.91	Ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to, be able not get shot at from an area where you're not looking.
3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI-1-rgb_front	3sZjSNcqXpI_5	3sZjSNcqXpI_5-1-rgb_front	70.42	81.82	If you're playing offense and you're up front, make sure you're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you.

3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front	3xni-I6N3EY_3	3xni-I6N3EY_3-1-rgb_front	51.2	54.29	You had observation as the key point.

3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY-1-rgb_front	3xni-I6N3EY_5	3xni-I6N3EY_5-1-rgb_front	90.78	103.72	In this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness.

40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_2	40JRPcYZkWg_2-1-rgb_front	17.87	23.72	The two big ones, I want to talk about though right now, are metal versus plastic.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_3	40JRPcYZkWg_3-1-rgb_front	24.75	28.17	If you remember, to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_4	40JRPcYZkWg_4-1-rgb_front	29.15	35.71	Typically, if you find metal processors, you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_5	40JRPcYZkWg_5-1-rgb_front	37.14	39.24	You also want to look for good mixing as well.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_6	40JRPcYZkWg_6-1-rgb_front	39.93	51.22	Also, because we are dealing with a flammable substance, methanol, it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_7	40JRPcYZkWg_7-1-rgb_front	53.45	63.16	Also, if you're heating within the tank, you don't want your tank to melt on you, so I kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_8	40JRPcYZkWg_8-1-rgb_front	63.98	73.33	Do your research, look hard but look for the plastic, look for the metal, see which ones work the best for you.
40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg-1-rgb_front	40JRPcYZkWg_9	40JRPcYZkWg_9-1-rgb_front	74.04	81.59	Again, calling it referrals, but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks.

48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_13	48Hj_AyP3Fk_13-2-rgb_front	70.67	73.05	She should be always looking for a cue from you.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_14	48Hj_AyP3Fk_14-2-rgb_front	73.22	85.01	So, and as you can see when I stop she sits and she's relaxed.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_15	48Hj_AyP3Fk_15-2-rgb_front	85.11	90.73	So, when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled.

48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_17	48Hj_AyP3Fk_17-2-rgb_front	95.46	101.63	This is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg and this has been how to walk a dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_2	48Hj_AyP3Fk_2-2-rgb_front	7.91	10.12	In this clip we're going to teach you how to walk a dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_3	48Hj_AyP3Fk_3-2-rgb_front	10.36	14.38	Now number one is with the leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_4	48Hj_AyP3Fk_4-2-rgb_front	14.61	29.97	Sometimes, you know, people get confident, over confident with their dogs off leash and, you know, something spooks a dog, it sees a cat, it runs out into the street and that can cause problems.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_5	48Hj_AyP3Fk_5-2-rgb_front	30.32	33.46	So walking a dog number one should be done on the leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_6	48Hj_AyP3Fk_6-2-rgb_front	33.69	37.57	Preferably a five to six foot leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_7	48Hj_AyP3Fk_7-2-rgb_front	37.77	40.33	I prefer a five foot leash.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_8	48Hj_AyP3Fk_8-2-rgb_front	40.5	51.61	And a leather leash, you know, your tools are, are your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog.
48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk-2-rgb_front	48Hj_AyP3Fk_9	48Hj_AyP3Fk_9-2-rgb_front	51.74	57.32	So, walking with your dog, you always want to make sure that you are the leader you're in the front.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_0_1	48hXSSOwsNE_0_1-2-rgb_front	0.47	13.7	On this segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets, and combinations. It's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_2	48hXSSOwsNE_2-2-rgb_front	13.79	16.19	It makes it a lot easier to, to complete the move.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_3	48hXSSOwsNE_3-2-rgb_front	16.25	31.34	So you really want your, your foot brushes to be right in front of you, so when you go to set it up and kick it, it's going to be right in your wheelhouse.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_4	48hXSSOwsNE_4-2-rgb_front	31.51	36.18	So now the wind has changed directions a little bit, so we're going to maybe go here.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_5	48hXSSOwsNE_5-2-rgb_front	36.44	40.08	So I'm going to toss it to Ryan; he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_6	48hXSSOwsNE_6-2-rgb_front	40.28	56.81	And if you notice, it was right in the perfect spot, right here, off of his set to my foot brush.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_7	48hXSSOwsNE_7-2-rgb_front	56.93	70.1	Now, if you want to do several different combinations where you're putting a couple of the foot brushes together, you could toss it up, kick it here, toss it up, here, here, here.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_8	48hXSSOwsNE_8-2-rgb_front	70.19	72.52	So you can do tons of different combos.
48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE-2-rgb_front	48hXSSOwsNE_9	48hXSSOwsNE_9-2-rgb_front	72.58	82.15	You can actually go there, left foot and right foot.

4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_3	4CSSlWonj3E_3-2-rgb_front	18.21	43.94	I'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and what I want to do is just give it a good slice lengthwise and maybe another time lengthwise, that's pretty good, just them out them together and just start to cut tiny little pieces.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_4	4CSSlWonj3E_4-2-rgb_front	43.95	46.67	I'm cutting these down, I'm going to cut all the way through.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_5	4CSSlWonj3E_5-2-rgb_front	48.83	61.96	We only need about a quarter cup of celery, but I like to chop these down even finer.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_6	4CSSlWonj3E_6-2-rgb_front	62.05	68.69	So what I'll do is then start again doing my chopping motion of my blade, coming--the back of the blade coming up and down.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_7	4CSSlWonj3E_7-2-rgb_front	72.01	82.63	All right, I got these chopped real fine the way I want it so I'm just going to add it to my bowl and I'm going to then chop up our zucchini.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_8	4CSSlWonj3E_8-2-rgb_front	82.77	88.09	We're just trying to chop up everything so it's all prepped; this is all our prep work right now.
4CSSlWonj3E	4CSSlWonj3E-2-rgb_front	4CSSlWonj3E_9	4CSSlWonj3E_9-2-rgb_front	88.11	88.87	So come on back.

4GG2H4QR9W8	4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front	4GG2H4QR9W8_3	4GG2H4QR9W8_3-2-rgb_front	24.52	33.76	First of all you have the tomato, the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around.
4GG2H4QR9W8	4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front	4GG2H4QR9W8_4	4GG2H4QR9W8_4-2-rgb_front	33.91	41.26	You want there to be no bruising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red.

4GG2H4QR9W8	4GG2H4QR9W8-2-rgb_front	4GG2H4QR9W8_7	4GG2H4QR9W8_7-2-rgb_front	65.68	82.06	You got your mango we want to make sure that your mango is pretty tender so if you push it down you can go in but you don't want it to be so soft where you thumb goes right through.

4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_0	4PKquZ1fUGk_0-2-rgb_front	0.33	6.15	The first product that I'm going to talk to about is a product called Egyptian Magic.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_1	4PKquZ1fUGk_1-2-rgb_front	6.46	13.58	This is one of my favorite things to use for hair, skin, lips, soars, everything.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_10	4PKquZ1fUGk_10-2-rgb_front	79.19	84.01	Just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturized.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_11	4PKquZ1fUGk_11-2-rgb_front	84.07	87.93	Since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_2	4PKquZ1fUGk_2-2-rgb_front	13.58	14.4	It's great.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_3	4PKquZ1fUGk_3-2-rgb_front	14.62	21.66	Now when it comes to this product, the best quality about it is that it's all natural ingredients.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_4	4PKquZ1fUGk_4-2-rgb_front	21.71	37.36	As you can see, it kind of starts out looking like a wax, but when you dig some out, you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_5_6	4PKquZ1fUGk_5_6-2-rgb_front	37.43	50.32	This makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through somebodies hair. This, I really like to use in pretreatment.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_7	4PKquZ1fUGk_7-2-rgb_front	50.48	62.6	If you rub a lot of this throughout the hair, it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and it keeps it moisturized throughout the whole braiding process.
4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk-2-rgb_front	4PKquZ1fUGk_8	4PKquZ1fUGk_8-2-rgb_front	63.05	67.12	That way it doesn't dry out anytime in the middle, but it's great for your skin.

4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_0	4VXvnpxTEEw_0-1-rgb_front	0.76	6.28	In this next clip we're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_1	4VXvnpxTEEw_1-1-rgb_front	6.39	9.15	This is a critical consideration when you're dealing with the outdoors.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_10	4VXvnpxTEEw_10-1-rgb_front	78.38	86.25	This wind chill chart is available from the NOA weather and the National Weather Service as a free download from their website.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_2	4VXvnpxTEEw_2-1-rgb_front	9.38	15.71	The wind chill and your dress.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_3	4VXvnpxTEEw_3-1-rgb_front	16.23	21.29	You dress for wind chill, not for the temperature that you have outside.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_4	4VXvnpxTEEw_4-1-rgb_front	22.2	30.39	For instance right here, since we been filming here for this clip, a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_5	4VXvnpxTEEw_5-1-rgb_front	30.76	36.43	And the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_6	4VXvnpxTEEw_6-1-rgb_front	37.02	50.11	So wind chill, we'll take a look at this wind chill chart and I'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_7	4VXvnpxTEEw_7-1-rgb_front	50.57	58.28	On this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top, and then you have the wind speed along the sides.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_8	4VXvnpxTEEw_8-1-rgb_front	58.38	65.13	And then you just cross reference your data and you'll come up with the actual real temperature, real life temperature that you have to dress for.
4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw-1-rgb_front	4VXvnpxTEEw_9	4VXvnpxTEEw_9-1-rgb_front	67.58	76.81	A five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_0	4XgOVMG-zIo_0-1-rgb_front	0.7	3.08	I'm going to show you how to make a Bluebird.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_1	4XgOVMG-zIo_1-1-rgb_front	3.24	6.4	Now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don't need much ice.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_10	4XgOVMG-zIo_10-1-rgb_front	39.7	44.17	Despite it's blue flavor, it has an orange taste behind it.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_11	4XgOVMG-zIo_11-1-rgb_front	45.6	51.82	Then you're going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_12	4XgOVMG-zIo_12-1-rgb_front	52.89	54.11	Do just a couple.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_13	4XgOVMG-zIo_13-1-rgb_front	40.36	41.07	That should be good.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_14	4XgOVMG-zIo_14-1-rgb_front	55.24	61.32	And then you're going to stir it so have your stirrer available.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_15	4XgOVMG-zIo_15-1-rgb_front	62.6	65.72	Put it in and twist it around just like that.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_16	4XgOVMG-zIo_16-1-rgb_front	66.24	67.11	Looks good.

4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_21	4XgOVMG-zIo_21-1-rgb_front	96.37	101.06	Pour in just like that, put in your straw and then you have a Blue Bird.
4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo-1-rgb_front	4XgOVMG-zIo_3	4XgOVMG-zIo_3-1-rgb_front	11.96	17.2	You're going to add an ounce and half of gin.

4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_0	4XlVMRXLydg_0-5-rgb_front	0.3	3.94	We're going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_1	4XlVMRXLydg_1-5-rgb_front	3.97	11.32	And I want you to, if you'd like to follow along with me, that'd be great.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_10	4XlVMRXLydg_10-5-rgb_front	74.96	91.75	There are so many movements in Qigung that, when you learn a great amount of Qigung, you could pick what you would like to do, what your body can handle.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_11	4XlVMRXLydg_11-5-rgb_front	91.95	92.87	OK?
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_12	4XlVMRXLydg_12-5-rgb_front	93.23	98.21	And, a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_13	4XlVMRXLydg_13-5-rgb_front	98.23	109.75	And what I'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_14	4XlVMRXLydg_14-5-rgb_front	110.65	118.22	So, we always want to start out in the Wu Chi posture.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_15	4XlVMRXLydg_15-5-rgb_front	118.56	122.11	Right -- first one, always stand in the Wu Chi posture.

4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_18	4XlVMRXLydg_18-5-rgb_front	134.12	136.51	Inhale, exhale.

4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_2	4XlVMRXLydg_2-5-rgb_front	11.46	23.38	But gathering chi from heaven and earth, one of the great things about Qigung is that the movements can be very, very simple.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_20	4XlVMRXLydg_20-5-rgb_front	137.14	157.69	From here, once you have a feeling of peace and focus, that the mind isn't racing around anymore, that you're very calm and relaxed, let's begin the movement then.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_21	4XlVMRXLydg_21-5-rgb_front	157.79	167.6	Then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do, which is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_3	4XlVMRXLydg_3-5-rgb_front	23.51	31.92	We don't have to do any complex movements here.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_4	4XlVMRXLydg_4-5-rgb_front	31.96	37.6	There are complex movements later on in higher levels of Qigung.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_5	4XlVMRXLydg_5-5-rgb_front	37.65	43.66	But the wonderful thing about Qigung is that Quigung can be done with any age group.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_6	4XlVMRXLydg_6-5-rgb_front	45.84	46.39	Any age group.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_7	4XlVMRXLydg_7-5-rgb_front	46.49	56.51	We have movements in Qigung that eighty year olds can do, ninety year olds can do.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_8	4XlVMRXLydg_8-5-rgb_front	56.63	66.05	We have movements in Quigung that require stronger flexibility, more endurance and so on.
4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg-5-rgb_front	4XlVMRXLydg_9	4XlVMRXLydg_9-5-rgb_front	66.52	73.99	But the point to this is that when you do Qigung, you can do so many different movements.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_0	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_0-5-rgb_front	0.09	11.55	Hi, my name's Floyd, I'm talking to you today from theacousticmusician.com in Sandy, Utah, and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_1	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_1-5-rgb_front	11.63	21.84	The most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_2	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_2-5-rgb_front	21.96	32.44	And that is this line here, and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_3	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_3-5-rgb_front	32.48	44.26	This would be your high E, this would be your low E, and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_4	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_4-5-rgb_front	44.4	53.21	Now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read.
5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ-5-rgb_front	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_5	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_5-5-rgb_front	53.35	68.4	But this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_0	5RR7dlzkyL0_0-5-rgb_front	0.23	12.56	Now first of all, I want to tell you, when you are doing business over the phone, you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_1	5RR7dlzkyL0_1-5-rgb_front	12.6	21.95	And what I'm talking about is, no longer do you have any non-verbalâs to work with.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_2	5RR7dlzkyL0_2-5-rgb_front	22.07	34.34	Whoever's on the other end of that phone, they can't see your face, they can't see your body, they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_3	5RR7dlzkyL0_3-5-rgb_front	34.44	40.08	So basically all you're left with is your tone of voice.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_4	5RR7dlzkyL0_4-5-rgb_front	40.18	52.35	Your attitude, which comes through in your tone of voice, and this is what you have to work with.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_5	5RR7dlzkyL0_5-5-rgb_front	52.45	56.41	This is what will convey your professionalism.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_6	5RR7dlzkyL0_6-5-rgb_front	56.55	68.65	This is what will convey your willingness to listen, and to help, and to be a professional.
5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0-5-rgb_front	5RR7dlzkyL0_7	5RR7dlzkyL0_7-5-rgb_front	68.78	75.56	So it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things.

BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front	BZqXT5UYUD8_10	BZqXT5UYUD8_10-5-rgb_front	65.35	71.66	Because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case, *73.
BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front	BZqXT5UYUD8_11	BZqXT5UYUD8_11-5-rgb_front	71.82	75.39	Listen and it will undo that call forwarding.

BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front	BZqXT5UYUD8_7	BZqXT5UYUD8_7-5-rgb_front	42.36	49.77	Generally, I would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to, and then automatically it happens, I don't think about it.
BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front	BZqXT5UYUD8_8	BZqXT5UYUD8_8-5-rgb_front	50.21	55.05	Hang up, walk away, it happens.
BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8-5-rgb_front	BZqXT5UYUD8_9	BZqXT5UYUD8_9-5-rgb_front	55.75	64.81	The easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it.

C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_0	C0fPZgeY2rg_0-5-rgb_front	0.81	3.05	How does a snake grow?
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_1	C0fPZgeY2rg_1-5-rgb_front	3.17	4.36	Well that's a good question.

C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_2	C0fPZgeY2rg_2-5-rgb_front	4.47	10.5	Snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_3	C0fPZgeY2rg_3-5-rgb_front	10.56	20.82	People shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_4	C0fPZgeY2rg_4-5-rgb_front	20.9	48.43	Snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake, well not really too much of a baby any more.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_5	C0fPZgeY2rg_5-5-rgb_front	48.58	57.35	What they do is they rub their head against something, here's the head over here.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_6	C0fPZgeY2rg_6-5-rgb_front	57.47	64.82	They rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_7	C0fPZgeY2rg_7-5-rgb_front	65.55	73.65	When it comes off of them and it is inside out.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_8	C0fPZgeY2rg_8-5-rgb_front	73.69	88.2	Then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake.
C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg-5-rgb_front	C0fPZgeY2rg_9	C0fPZgeY2rg_9-5-rgb_front	88.41	108.7	A baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing.

C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_11	C4lsh3mZ4jU_11-5-rgb_front	178.55	201.33	Now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_12	C4lsh3mZ4jU_12-5-rgb_front	201.54	210.49	Just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_13	C4lsh3mZ4jU_13-5-rgb_front	210.9	220.01	As long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_14	C4lsh3mZ4jU_14-5-rgb_front	220.09	222.12	You pull that through.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_15	C4lsh3mZ4jU_15-5-rgb_front	222.18	237.15	See how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and I will show you what to do.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_16	C4lsh3mZ4jU_16-5-rgb_front	237.57	257.41	Okay so then once we get a bunch f those, we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_17	C4lsh3mZ4jU_17-5-rgb_front	257.46	259.89	It almost looks ike a seam.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_18	C4lsh3mZ4jU_18-5-rgb_front	259.99	267.93	So the smaller the stitches, the more delicate the repair will be.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_2	C4lsh3mZ4jU_2-5-rgb_front	3.48	9.45	Now I am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_3	C4lsh3mZ4jU_3-5-rgb_front	9.62	21.35	Okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_4	C4lsh3mZ4jU_4-5-rgb_front	21.47	36.39	Match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what I am doing and what the stitch looks like I am going to use black thread.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_5	C4lsh3mZ4jU_5-5-rgb_front	36.51	40.99	That should make it easier for you to see this.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_6	C4lsh3mZ4jU_6-5-rgb_front	42.25	58.2	You want to knot your thread like I showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_7	C4lsh3mZ4jU_7-5-rgb_front	58.33	116.32	You are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch, probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out, you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_8	C4lsh3mZ4jU_8-5-rgb_front	128.85	142.51	You are going to start very small and close and a little wider, a little wider and you will see what we are going to get.
C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU-5-rgb_front	C4lsh3mZ4jU_9_10	C4lsh3mZ4jU_9_10-5-rgb_front	144.22	164.99	There you go. Now your stitches start off small, bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here.
C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front	C6fVNI9QLYU_1	C6fVNI9QLYU_1-5-rgb_front	9.1	27.57	You can't see it, so I don't know what to explain it, it's not a box blade so whatever, when you have it at an angle, whatever, whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have, you'll have stock piled down at the end.
C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front	C6fVNI9QLYU_2	C6fVNI9QLYU_2-5-rgb_front	27.71	32.94	It doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through.
C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front	C6fVNI9QLYU_3	C6fVNI9QLYU_3-5-rgb_front	33.03	43.02	It'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side.
C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front	C6fVNI9QLYU_4	C6fVNI9QLYU_4-5-rgb_front	43.06	58.18	But this, unlike the box blade, is not boxed in, so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side.
C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU-5-rgb_front	C6fVNI9QLYU_5	C6fVNI9QLYU_5-5-rgb_front	58.21	71.62	And you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road, off to the side of the road, and that's what this kind of blade would be for.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_0	C9ordUxwOEQ_0-5-rgb_front	1.16	5.46	This is a tire pressure gauge.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_1	C9ordUxwOEQ_1-5-rgb_front	5.51	20.68	You check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in, depending on track conditions, the track continues to change every single time you go out there.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_2	C9ordUxwOEQ_2-5-rgb_front	20.78	25.11	This is really easy to use, its got a number gauge on it.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_3	C9ordUxwOEQ_3-5-rgb_front	25.23	30.82	You just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_4	C9ordUxwOEQ_4-5-rgb_front	30.93	40.69	You just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_5	C9ordUxwOEQ_5-5-rgb_front	40.86	41.82	Its really easy to use.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_6	C9ordUxwOEQ_6-5-rgb_front	41.88	63.27	You can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized, the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out.
C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ-5-rgb_front	C9ordUxwOEQ_7	C9ordUxwOEQ_7-5-rgb_front	63.36	80.67	It depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two PSI your taking in or out of the tire.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_0	CFRh_KOT9nY_0-5-rgb_front	0.51	6.57	Hi, this is Jon, and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_1	CFRh_KOT9nY_1-5-rgb_front	7.5	14.71	As you begin to accessorize your wood shop, you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_2	CFRh_KOT9nY_2-5-rgb_front	15.51	23.8	You'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs, and at the other side we just have our standard feet.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_3	CFRh_KOT9nY_3-5-rgb_front	24.55	43.61	Now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station, so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station, maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_4	CFRh_KOT9nY_4-5-rgb_front	44.74	66.74	"Now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable, or if you're looking for more of a custom, mobile workbench, you can always go on line and search for ""free mobile workbench plans"" and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself."
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_5	CFRh_KOT9nY_5-5-rgb_front	67.71	72.42	Now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal.
CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY-5-rgb_front	CFRh_KOT9nY_6	CFRh_KOT9nY_6-5-rgb_front	72.72	91.67	Now if the surface gets scratched, it will scratch your lumber, so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one, you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched, you could refinish it and make it smooth again.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_0	CO6qyvvglAE_0-5-rgb_front	0.44	5.75	And now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_1	CO6qyvvglAE_1-5-rgb_front	6.68	11.04	Here we have the Denon DNC635 CD player.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_10	CO6qyvvglAE_10-5-rgb_front	34.41	50.02	Important things you need to know about the Denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called Push, and you turn it sideways.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_11	CO6qyvvglAE_11-5-rgb_front	50.15	52.97	Don't push it, turn it sideways.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_12	CO6qyvvglAE_12-5-rgb_front	53.06	56.44	And you can see the track numbers is advancing.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_13	CO6qyvvglAE_13-5-rgb_front	56.53	57.22	One, two, three.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_14	CO6qyvvglAE_14-5-rgb_front	57.42	57.8	OK?
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_15	CO6qyvvglAE_15-5-rgb_front	57.84	59.82	So there we go.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_16	CO6qyvvglAE_16-5-rgb_front	61.69	64.76	That's how you change tracks.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_17	CO6qyvvglAE_17-5-rgb_front	64.81	68.98	And when you're ready to play, hit play, obviously.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_18	CO6qyvvglAE_18-5-rgb_front	69.06	91.54	Now a great feature of the Denon CD player is, if you decide this is the track you want, instead of hitting pause, which just pauses it, or hitting stop, which actually would bring you back to track one, you can hit, go find the track you want again, track three in this case.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_19	CO6qyvvglAE_19-5-rgb_front	91.55	92.42	Hit play.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_2	CO6qyvvglAE_2-5-rgb_front	11.15	15.55	Has many features.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_20	CO6qyvvglAE_20-5-rgb_front	92.49	94.49	Yes that's what I want.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_21	CO6qyvvglAE_21-5-rgb_front	94.55	102.94	And then you hit the Cue button and what that does is, is it brings you back to the beginning of track three.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_22	CO6qyvvglAE_22-5-rgb_front	102.97	114.66	So find your track with the, turning this button that says Push on it, paradoxically.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_23	CO6qyvvglAE_23-5-rgb_front	114.75	117.83	And then use Cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_3	CO6qyvvglAE_3-5-rgb_front	15.65	17.9	Some of which aren't fantastically useful.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_4	CO6qyvvglAE_4-5-rgb_front	18.0	20.49	Let's play some music here.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_5	CO6qyvvglAE_5-5-rgb_front	20.57	21.09	OK.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_6	CO6qyvvglAE_6-5-rgb_front	21.16	26.46	So it has your basic CD player features.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_7	CO6qyvvglAE_7-5-rgb_front	27.15	29.19	Stop, obviously, duh.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_8	CO6qyvvglAE_8-5-rgb_front	29.28	30.67	Play, woohoo.
CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE-5-rgb_front	CO6qyvvglAE_9	CO6qyvvglAE_9-5-rgb_front	30.68	34.37	And you know Pause, no surprise there.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_0	CSxgJLYMLZ4_0-5-rgb_front	1.16	14.21	Another very good use, although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_1	CSxgJLYMLZ4_1-5-rgb_front	14.79	26.87	Now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort, so you can use it.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_2	CSxgJLYMLZ4_2-5-rgb_front	26.88	40.64	You need a lot of people, the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_3	CSxgJLYMLZ4_3-5-rgb_front	40.73	53.32	The head should be at the front, so that way if the feet get dropped into the water, the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_4-5-rgb_front	54.11	66.15	Now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_5	CSxgJLYMLZ4_5-5-rgb_front	66.93	76.07	If at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board.
CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4-5-rgb_front	CSxgJLYMLZ4_6	CSxgJLYMLZ4_6-5-rgb_front	76.21	86.39	If you have the opportunity to do this, that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_0	CzkLI34HFIg_0-5-rgb_front	0.2	6.76	So I'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_1	CzkLI34HFIg_1-5-rgb_front	6.82	11.46	And I'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_10	CzkLI34HFIg_10-5-rgb_front	82.7	97.7	Okay, so now that I have this pressed down, I'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out, because I need to see that excess fabric, so I can determine where I'm going to cut it off.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_11	CzkLI34HFIg_11-5-rgb_front	99.02	101.71	Okay, here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_12	CzkLI34HFIg_12-5-rgb_front	101.81	112.02	And when I do this, if I have to cut off the fabric I like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_13	CzkLI34HFIg_13-5-rgb_front	112.07	121.8	And that's a good idea just in case, say someone else wants to wear them, they'll have a little bit to work with.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_14	CzkLI34HFIg_14-5-rgb_front	121.97	130.32	If they need to let the hem out, because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_15	CzkLI34HFIg_15-5-rgb_front	130.44	140.27	So, I'm just going to start right here where I put that one little seam that I sewed myself, and mark 1 inch.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_16	CzkLI34HFIg_16-5-rgb_front	140.32	141.83	Here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_17	CzkLI34HFIg_17-5-rgb_front	141.87	145.24	And on this side, and also on the next side.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_18	CzkLI34HFIg_18-5-rgb_front	145.31	162.32	Okay, it's all the way around.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_19	CzkLI34HFIg_19-5-rgb_front	162.51	171.37	So, in a minute I'm going to show you how, I'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_2	CzkLI34HFIg_2-5-rgb_front	11.5	17.62	So let's go over here to my work table/ironing table, and here we go.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_20	CzkLI34HFIg_20-5-rgb_front	171.42	174.42	And I'll show you how to do that next.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_3	CzkLI34HFIg_3-5-rgb_front	17.66	29.47	So the first thing I want to do is go ahead and iron this down, just like I did the other leg, just kind of pull it a tiny bit, there we go.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_4	CzkLI34HFIg_4-5-rgb_front	29.48	34.9	I'm just going to iron right here along the seam.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_5	CzkLI34HFIg_5-5-rgb_front	34.94	50.77	And like I said before, I like do that just because I know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be, and you give it that little press.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_6	CzkLI34HFIg_6-5-rgb_front	50.88	53.59	Now this side, okay.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_7	CzkLI34HFIg_7-5-rgb_front	53.68	67.63	Then we're going to open it and get that crease that I put there, out.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_8	CzkLI34HFIg_8-5-rgb_front	67.67	69.66	I'm going to do the inside also.
CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg-5-rgb_front	CzkLI34HFIg_9	CzkLI34HFIg_9-5-rgb_front	71.43	82.65	Okay, because we've already done this once, so I'm just going to get after and do it.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_1	D4NatJnEMBU_1-5-rgb_front	17.01	34.03	Okay sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_2	D4NatJnEMBU_2-5-rgb_front	34.08	49.58	Into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose, you can do chicken, turkey, catfish I mean basically anything.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_3	D4NatJnEMBU_3-5-rgb_front	53.73	65.35	The trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_4	D4NatJnEMBU_4-5-rgb_front	65.47	82.84	Today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_5	D4NatJnEMBU_5-5-rgb_front	84.47	96.56	Another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite.
D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU-5-rgb_front	D4NatJnEMBU_6	D4NatJnEMBU_6-5-rgb_front	96.82	108.23	For this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let's get started.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_0	DEdVsXBut4I_0-5-rgb_front	0.5	18.24	Ace 2 suited, ace 3 suited; this is pretty much the best Omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_1	DEdVsXBut4I_1-5-rgb_front	20.23	24.92	It gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_2	DEdVsXBut4I_2-5-rgb_front	24.98	37.41	With these, you can pick up a high of a straight, you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_3	DEdVsXBut4I_3-5-rgb_front	37.58	50.76	So you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_4	DEdVsXBut4I_4-5-rgb_front	50.81	53.03	What does that mean visually?
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_5	DEdVsXBut4I_5-5-rgb_front	53.12	56.61	Well let's take a look at this board here that I laid out.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_6	DEdVsXBut4I_6-5-rgb_front	57.11	78.96	We got a board of Jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for Omaha high low.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_7	DEdVsXBut4I_7-5-rgb_front	79.06	89.43	But played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_8	DEdVsXBut4I_8-5-rgb_front	89.7	104.97	At last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5.
DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I-5-rgb_front	DEdVsXBut4I_9	DEdVsXBut4I_9-5-rgb_front	105.08	119.26	We on the other hand have a low hand, we have 8, 5, 3, deuce, ace so we would win half of the pot.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_0	DKJtnSrjIro_0-5-rgb_front	0.2	7.05	So we have the bottom prepared, and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal, and this is set up as well.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_1	DKJtnSrjIro_1-5-rgb_front	7.62	9.79	It also is leather hard.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_10	DKJtnSrjIro_10-5-rgb_front	58.91	67.34	So again, I'm going to spin it, and I'm going to tap it on center.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_11	DKJtnSrjIro_11-5-rgb_front	67.37	75.8	And press down in the middle, you notice it slid at first, that was the suction releasing.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_12	DKJtnSrjIro_12-5-rgb_front	75.88	80.83	You press down in the middle, and that recreates that suction.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_13	DKJtnSrjIro_13-5-rgb_front	80.98	86.85	So it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming, that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_14	DKJtnSrjIro_14-5-rgb_front	86.88	89.98	And next, we'll trim it.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_2	DKJtnSrjIro_2-5-rgb_front	10.13	14.7	Now, as you can see when I set it on there, it's a little too big.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_3	DKJtnSrjIro_3-5-rgb_front	16.12	19.61	It doesn't quite slip into that pedestal.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_4	DKJtnSrjIro_4-5-rgb_front	13.94	15.47	So I have to trim this as well.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_5	DKJtnSrjIro_5-5-rgb_front	20.53	30.06	So, what I need to do, in order to trim this, first you want to get the wheel head wet.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_6	DKJtnSrjIro_6-5-rgb_front	30.06	38.4	This is important because I just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_7	DKJtnSrjIro_7-5-rgb_front	39.72	53.56	And that's going to happen because when I put this wet lip against this wet piece, and I'm going to drop it kind of hard.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_8	DKJtnSrjIro_8-5-rgb_front	53.58	55.86	And now it's sucked on there.
DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro-5-rgb_front	DKJtnSrjIro_9	DKJtnSrjIro_9-5-rgb_front	56.52	58.83	I'm hitting and it's not moving.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_0	DKOzSnHwSFI_0-5-rgb_front	1.83	11.58	Hi, my name is Dave Schoeneck and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_1	DKOzSnHwSFI_1-5-rgb_front	11.7	18.28	In some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_10	DKOzSnHwSFI_10-5-rgb_front	101.02	107.77	It's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_2	DKOzSnHwSFI_2-5-rgb_front	18.34	21.08	Upper body and abdominal exercises.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_3	DKOzSnHwSFI_3-5-rgb_front	21.14	30.59	That always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_4	DKOzSnHwSFI_4-5-rgb_front	30.72	41.15	You probably will use muscles that you haven't used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_5	DKOzSnHwSFI_5-5-rgb_front	41.3	49.66	At having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_6	DKOzSnHwSFI_6-5-rgb_front	49.77	62.68	But again, the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_7	DKOzSnHwSFI_7-5-rgb_front	62.87	73.17	Some of the muscles that you'll use would be obviously your forearms, your biceps, your lats, your back.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_8	DKOzSnHwSFI_8-5-rgb_front	73.28	93.25	There'll be a number of things you will, can't find muscles that you didn't, forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work.
DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI-5-rgb_front	DKOzSnHwSFI_9	DKOzSnHwSFI_9-5-rgb_front	93.33	100.93	So but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_0	DdzxfgB4W2c_0-5-rgb_front	0.26	0.8	Okay.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_1	DdzxfgB4W2c_1-5-rgb_front	0.85	6.48	Our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes, so now it's time to take it out.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_10	DdzxfgB4W2c_10-5-rgb_front	46.67	52.51	This is -- we're just going take our knife and the broccoli, and just cut the ends off of our florets like so.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_11	DdzxfgB4W2c_11-5-rgb_front	53.2	62.23	Just enough for two people is what we need to do.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_12	DdzxfgB4W2c_12-5-rgb_front	62.36	70.51	And if you have more than two people, you're welcome to save these stems and eat them too, if you'd like.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_13	DdzxfgB4W2c_13-5-rgb_front	70.58	74.43	I happen to prefer just the broccoli florets.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_14	DdzxfgB4W2c_14-5-rgb_front	76.47	82.88	And to this, we're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_15	DdzxfgB4W2c_15-5-rgb_front	82.96	85.51	We just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_16	DdzxfgB4W2c_16-5-rgb_front	86.05	92.71	And I'm going to put the broccoli florets in here like so.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_17	DdzxfgB4W2c_17-5-rgb_front	93.2	108.9	I'm going to cover them, and I'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and I'm going to boil them with high heat.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_18	DdzxfgB4W2c_18-5-rgb_front	109.82	119.07	So just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming, so it's not going to be overcooked so it's going to be a bright green.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_19	DdzxfgB4W2c_19-5-rgb_front	119.1	122.89	And I'm going to check them every once in a while, but it takes about 10 minutes to cook.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_2	DdzxfgB4W2c_2-5-rgb_front	8.71	13.82	You can see the garlic is still in there, and here's our fish packet.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_20	DdzxfgB4W2c_20-5-rgb_front	122.98	127.08	So keep clicking, we're getting close to putting it all together.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_3	DdzxfgB4W2c_3-5-rgb_front	13.98	14.95	Yum.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_4	DdzxfgB4W2c_4-5-rgb_front	15.01	17.56	The garlic still needs to cook.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_5	DdzxfgB4W2c_5-5-rgb_front	14.26	14.9	Here we go.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_6	DdzxfgB4W2c_6-5-rgb_front	17.85	27.84	Now, we're just going to let this sit here and do what I like to call residual cooking.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_7	DdzxfgB4W2c_7-5-rgb_front	27.98	34.0	Actually, all meats do that when you take them out of the heat, the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_8	DdzxfgB4W2c_8-5-rgb_front	34.17	40.59	And that's what's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture, soft texture.
DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c-5-rgb_front	DdzxfgB4W2c_9	DdzxfgB4W2c_9-5-rgb_front	41.75	45.85	So meanwhile, let's just quickly do our broccoli.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_0	DfnHNkTE7mE_0-5-rgb_front	1.13	8.18	I got my first job back in 1984 on a TV series called Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_1	DfnHNkTE7mE_1-5-rgb_front	8.68	17.39	They were down in Miami filming locally, of course, where the series was shot.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_10	DfnHNkTE7mE_10-5-rgb_front	63.51	73.29	I think I was a little bit thinner, a lot thinner then and I had really high cheekbones and because of the way I looked, somehow I had a Russian look to me.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_11_12	DfnHNkTE7mE_11_12-5-rgb_front	73.39	81.85	"And the director who happened to be Eddie Olmos who played Capt. Castillo on the series, he saw my face and said, ""Strong face, great bones."
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_13	DfnHNkTE7mE_13-5-rgb_front	81.99	83.82	Looks Russian to me.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_14	DfnHNkTE7mE_14-5-rgb_front	84.37	85.63	"Let's put him in the suit"", so to speak."
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_15	DfnHNkTE7mE_15-5-rgb_front	85.67	93.33	So I was an ex-KGB guy running around trying to kill Crockett and Tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_16	DfnHNkTE7mE_16-5-rgb_front	93.37	104.7	I think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_17	DfnHNkTE7mE_17-5-rgb_front	104.93	109.67	I did Monster with Charlize Theron in 2004.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_18	DfnHNkTE7mE_18-5-rgb_front	110.21	112.66	And it was a little independent movie.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_19	DfnHNkTE7mE_19-5-rgb_front	112.73	121.96	It was actually lower that the Screen Actors Guild's standard, and we all got a low budget pay for it.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_2	DfnHNkTE7mE_2-5-rgb_front	17.77	32.37	And a call came out to all the actors, aspiring actors in the area, that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera, to work on a TV show called Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_20	DfnHNkTE7mE_20-5-rgb_front	122.0	134.28	But, you know, that's the great thing about this business, you never know where or how the project you're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated, you know, as some films do.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_21	DfnHNkTE7mE_21-5-rgb_front	134.34	140.53	And for her, it got her an Academy Award.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_22	DfnHNkTE7mE_22-5-rgb_front	140.63	144.5	So I was in a scene with Charlize Theron in Monster.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_23	DfnHNkTE7mE_23-5-rgb_front	144.58	162.89	And during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that, I think that it was either the Screen Actors Guild Award show, which was telecast on TNT or something, Turner's Broadcasting who showed that, she mentioned my name.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_24	DfnHNkTE7mE_24-5-rgb_front	162.96	163.93	She thanked me.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_25	DfnHNkTE7mE_25-5-rgb_front	164.04	167.34	And I only worked one night with her.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_26	DfnHNkTE7mE_26-5-rgb_front	167.48	171.6	We had a long scene to do.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_27	DfnHNkTE7mE_27-5-rgb_front	171.81	179.18	I remember it being very cold and I was very bloody and in my underwear, which makes you wonder, wow, I've got to go back and rent that now.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_28	DfnHNkTE7mE_28-5-rgb_front	179.28	186.6	So yeah, do that, go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me, I'd appreciate it.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_29	DfnHNkTE7mE_29-5-rgb_front	186.62	189.68	So, go rent the movie and check out the scene.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_3	DfnHNkTE7mE_3-5-rgb_front	32.42	35.31	So I went in, not knowing what to expect, really, you know.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_4	DfnHNkTE7mE_4-5-rgb_front	35.5	37.86	This was my first introduction to it and I got sides.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_5	DfnHNkTE7mE_5-5-rgb_front	38.0	46.82	"And I was told, you know, ""Memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and I'm going to put you on camera doing this."""
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_6	DfnHNkTE7mE_6-5-rgb_front	46.83	52.07	So I did that and they liked me.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_7	DfnHNkTE7mE_7-5-rgb_front	52.16	55.09	And I got hired as an actor on Miami Vice.
DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE-5-rgb_front	DfnHNkTE7mE_8	DfnHNkTE7mE_8-5-rgb_front	55.29	57.25	That was my first job.

aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front	aUBqWgdXamE_3	aUBqWgdXamE_3-3-rgb_front	28.89	31.96	I think we've probably solved our problems.
aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front	aUBqWgdXamE_4	aUBqWgdXamE_4-3-rgb_front	32.44	37.72	At this point, is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower.

aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE-3-rgb_front	aUBqWgdXamE_6	aUBqWgdXamE_6-3-rgb_front	41.05	44.08	It is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_1	abzRFn8xngA_1-3-rgb_front	6.31	14.5	Normally what I would do if I was doing a spell for healing, is I would write out a petition.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_2	abzRFn8xngA_2-3-rgb_front	14.58	20.84	And that would be almost like a prayer, saying what I intend to do and for whom I intend to do it.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_3	abzRFn8xngA_3-3-rgb_front	21.02	29.03	Then I sometimes use a poppet, as I had mentioned before, and I wrap herbs around it.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_4	abzRFn8xngA_4-3-rgb_front	29.09	35.67	Or if say they had a broken leg, I would concentrate the healing on the leg part.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_5	abzRFn8xngA_5-3-rgb_front	36.06	44.67	Sometimes what I do is I'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face, so that it actually looks like the person.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_6	abzRFn8xngA_6-3-rgb_front	44.8	47.92	That's called sympathetic magic.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_7	abzRFn8xngA_7-3-rgb_front	48.34	53.2	Where I'm not actually doing the magic on somebody, but I'm doing it on something instead.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_8	abzRFn8xngA_8-3-rgb_front	53.32	63.78	And then I would place it on the pentacle, and I would continue with the spell saying what I would want for the healing and want for the person.
abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA-3-rgb_front	abzRFn8xngA_9	abzRFn8xngA_9-3-rgb_front	63.94	71.25	And of course, for the highest good of all, and that it harm none.
afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front	afDfb8xx09w_0	afDfb8xx09w_0-3-rgb_front	0.49	4.02	Now we're going to be talking about direction of the ball.
afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front	afDfb8xx09w_1	afDfb8xx09w_1-3-rgb_front	4.19	7.9	Basically, you have two directions that we're going to be talking about.
afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front	afDfb8xx09w_7	afDfb8xx09w_7-3-rgb_front	71.76	78.89	For forehand on the line, the same concept; you're going to be hitting the ball.
afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w-3-rgb_front	afDfb8xx09w_8	afDfb8xx09w_8-3-rgb_front	78.93	82.22	You're going to hit it just a little more behind.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_0	ahJr2i50Qew_0-3-rgb_front	0.59	14.67	One thing, as you notice we don't have any three point lines here but, that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during, sometime during that period, is the three point line.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_1	ahJr2i50Qew_1-3-rgb_front	14.85	28.7	The three point line is actually, I talked about it earlier, is nineteen point nine for college and high school, and actually NBA, the NBA line is a little further out, it's at twenty three, nine, twenty three feet, nine inches.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_10	ahJr2i50Qew_10-3-rgb_front	86.18	95.2	So, same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it, shooting the three point shot.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_2	ahJr2i50Qew_2-3-rgb_front	28.79	33.22	So, whenever you're shooting same shooting mechanics apply.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_3	ahJr2i50Qew_3-3-rgb_front	33.29	36.43	You want to take your, take your three point shot.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_4	ahJr2i50Qew_4-3-rgb_front	36.54	44.66	I'm going to show you, I'm going to take, actually go across court here and show you exactly, what a round about what a three point shot would be, being is how we don't have, actually have a three point line on our court.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_5	ahJr2i50Qew_5-3-rgb_front	44.92	46.44	So, check me out.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_6	ahJr2i50Qew_6-3-rgb_front	47.45	67.79	When you're coming over here and you're shooting a three point shot, same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot, no changes, you just might, down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot, unless you're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_7	ahJr2i50Qew_7-3-rgb_front	68.0	77.38	So, when you're taking a, taking your three point shot, you want to make sure if you're playing outside, outdoors, you got to allot for the wind, that's the thing about playing outside.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_8	ahJr2i50Qew_8-3-rgb_front	77.44	79.6	You've always got to allot for the wind.
ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew-3-rgb_front	ahJr2i50Qew_9	ahJr2i50Qew_9-3-rgb_front	79.66	86.11	So, if you're taking this a little more distance, so when you're shooting the three point shot, you allot for the wind and there you go just like that, you take the shot.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_0	aoJDJktJkzw_0-3-rgb_front	4.21	27.63	Okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_1	aoJDJktJkzw_1-3-rgb_front	28.06	36.33	The cucumber is not stiff anymore, I mean it would still break and when you eat it, it has a nice crunch to it.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_2	aoJDJktJkzw_2-3-rgb_front	36.5	43.61	So once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_3	aoJDJktJkzw_3-3-rgb_front	43.7	58.63	Spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_4	aoJDJktJkzw_4-3-rgb_front	58.78	74.63	You can do it over the rice, the side of the rice, you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the Asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi.
aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw-3-rgb_front	aoJDJktJkzw_5	aoJDJktJkzw_5-3-rgb_front	74.71	79.92	I'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic Korean meal vegetarian.

at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front	at8bAQq9jZY_2	at8bAQq9jZY_2-3-rgb_front	17.5	30.68	A loop station is basically a live recording its a XOR input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have, that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record.
at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front	at8bAQq9jZY_3	at8bAQq9jZY_3-3-rgb_front	30.86	44.7	When you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience, and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it.
at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front	at8bAQq9jZY_4	at8bAQq9jZY_4-3-rgb_front	44.83	54.46	It's very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage.
at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY-3-rgb_front	at8bAQq9jZY_5	at8bAQq9jZY_5-3-rgb_front	54.68	65.49	People really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to broaden your musical horizons.

b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front	b-mHbL3d2ec_2	b-mHbL3d2ec_2-3-rgb_front	37.28	56.34	And when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart, if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together, see how the onion stays together.
b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front	b-mHbL3d2ec_3	b-mHbL3d2ec_3-3-rgb_front	56.39	72.08	And then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section.
b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front	b-mHbL3d2ec_4	b-mHbL3d2ec_4-3-rgb_front	74.28	102.66	Set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off, and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted, and it's very quick to cut an onion like this.
b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front	b-mHbL3d2ec_5	b-mHbL3d2ec_5-3-rgb_front	106.78	130.97	Just continue that with all your onions now I'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off.
b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec-3-rgb_front	b-mHbL3d2ec_6	b-mHbL3d2ec_6-3-rgb_front	131.09	150.12	Another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off, I'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we'll prep the leak.

bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_0	bBHYQCDp_9A_0-3-rgb_front	0.34	8.29	When you're running a press, the defense is running a press, one thing that you want to learn how to do, is break that press.

bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_11	bBHYQCDp_9A_11-3-rgb_front	103.08	115.7	The press, once a guard has the ball, in the middle of the court, the press is pretty much broken, then the, then the thing is finding someone to pass it to, and getting it down court.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_12	bBHYQCDp_9A_12-3-rgb_front	116.49	126.08	So, try your best to get that person, whoever is going to have the ball, after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court, so that they have options on the right, and on their left.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_13	bBHYQCDp_9A_13-3-rgb_front	126.22	130.21	Once that happens, there you have it, breaking the press.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_2	bBHYQCDp_9A_2-3-rgb_front	14.14	25.86	Number one, when there is a press, a defensive press, what you want to make sure you do is, when you have the guy in, the person inbound the ball, you want to make sure that they have options.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_3	bBHYQCDp_9A_3-3-rgb_front	25.87	34.98	Somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble, cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds, when they get in trouble, they can find someone to pass it to.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_4	bBHYQCDp_9A_4-3-rgb_front	35.61	39.72	Usually, it'll be, you'll have two guards, you'll have your point guard, and your shooting guard back here.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_5	bBHYQCDp_9A_5-3-rgb_front	39.77	57.25	And, what they'll do for each other, is they'll set screens, and when he or she smacks the ball, you'll have them split, to try to get open, once the ball is inbound and they get the ball, then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game, and look for their options.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_6	bBHYQCDp_9A_6-3-rgb_front	57.34	67.43	Now, the two guards are back here, you'll have, you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key, on the opposite top of the key.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_7	bBHYQCDp_9A_7-3-rgb_front	67.51	75.94	But, you also want to have your forwards around half court, so that they have, so that your guards have options, if they get in trouble.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_8	bBHYQCDp_9A_8-3-rgb_front	76.22	90.08	Now, you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within, within the time frame, the ten second time frame, but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press, there's pressure, there's going to be pressure that gets you, that's what the press is.
bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A-3-rgb_front	bBHYQCDp_9A_9	bBHYQCDp_9A_9-3-rgb_front	90.75	99.37	So, you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving, and constantly setting screens for each other, so they can get open.

bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_13	bHdXYjk977I_13-3-rgb_front	78.23	80.15	There is the beads.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_14	bHdXYjk977I_14-3-rgb_front	80.3	89.78	We will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_15	bHdXYjk977I_15-3-rgb_front	89.96	91.51	That will be the beginning of it.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_2	bHdXYjk977I_2-3-rgb_front	18.84	24.17	So I am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_3	bHdXYjk977I_3-3-rgb_front	24.32	26.16	This is the type of bead I am going to use.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_4	bHdXYjk977I_4-3-rgb_front	26.2	27.72	It?s called a flat disk.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_5	bHdXYjk977I_5-3-rgb_front	27.88	36.94	There is also this type but I am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it?s going to be sixteen inches.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_6	bHdXYjk977I_6-3-rgb_front	37.38	43.22	And most manufacturers when you buy your beads, they come in sixteen inch length.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_7	bHdXYjk977I_7-3-rgb_front	43.48	48.27	Now because this is such a simple design here I thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_8	bHdXYjk977I_8-3-rgb_front	48.35	53.56	So I was going through my large beads here and I was looking to see which one would match up nicely.
bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I-3-rgb_front	bHdXYjk977I_9	bHdXYjk977I_9-3-rgb_front	53.61	57.08	This one looks a little too blue here.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_0	bIUmw2DVW7Q_0-3-rgb_front	0.46	3.63	A wrist control that we can use from a slashing attack.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_1	bIUmw2DVW7Q_1-3-rgb_front	3.68	4.69	We're going to do it from the outside.

bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_11	bIUmw2DVW7Q_11-3-rgb_front	29.3	33.6	The blade's far enough away from me that if it misses it misses.

bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_15	bIUmw2DVW7Q_15-3-rgb_front	37.7	39.23	He wants to bring it back naturally.

bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_19	bIUmw2DVW7Q_19-3-rgb_front	46.52	47.54	He want to bring it up?
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_2	bIUmw2DVW7Q_2-3-rgb_front	4.75	6.5	We want to create a protective barrier once again.

bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_22	bIUmw2DVW7Q_22-3-rgb_front	52.75	54.4	Boom.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_23	bIUmw2DVW7Q_23-3-rgb_front	54.52	58.86	We want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_24	bIUmw2DVW7Q_24-3-rgb_front	58.95	65.19	This motion is nice and small in an ever shrinking circle going gently past his forearm down into the ground.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_25	bIUmw2DVW7Q_25-3-rgb_front	65.21	68.63	I don't want to heave him 40 yards away.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_26	bIUmw2DVW7Q_26-3-rgb_front	68.7	72.31	I want him on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_27	bIUmw2DVW7Q_27-3-rgb_front	72.35	74.04	Here and down we go to the ground.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_28	bIUmw2DVW7Q_28-3-rgb_front	74.65	78.96	And that is a good wrist control from a slashing attack.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_3_4_5	bIUmw2DVW7Q_3_4_5-3-rgb_front	6.7	18.72	Create a diversionary framework. A Danny comes in here I want to follow that motion. Trap on top of the wrist right here and as he begins to pull back to get into position I want to follow him once again.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_6	bIUmw2DVW7Q_6-3-rgb_front	18.82	20.5	A technique we have seen several times before.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_7	bIUmw2DVW7Q_7-3-rgb_front	20.63	22.17	Because it's exceptionally effective.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_8	bIUmw2DVW7Q_8-3-rgb_front	22.18	24.29	Which is why we're seeing it again.
bIUmw2DVW7Q	bIUmw2DVW7Q-3-rgb_front	bIUmw2DVW7Q_9	bIUmw2DVW7Q_9-3-rgb_front	24.4	27.11	Here I create my protective line.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_0	bUFsn9GQsCg_0-8-rgb_front	1.01	5.53	I have some very good news for you about the Feral cat.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_1	bUFsn9GQsCg_1-8-rgb_front	5.69	21.13	The Los Angeles Police Department is now employing Feral cats, who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters, to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other, the central branch.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_10	bUFsn9GQsCg_10-8-rgb_front	70.36	76.22	Very cute, and of course, people want to buy them, they're Turkish Angoras.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_11	bUFsn9GQsCg_11-8-rgb_front	76.41	81.01	The idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_12	bUFsn9GQsCg_12-8-rgb_front	81.2	82.82	Right now, it's just a very cute idea.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_13	bUFsn9GQsCg_13-8-rgb_front	84.41	86.0	And you know what I say to that?
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_14	bUFsn9GQsCg_14-8-rgb_front	86.43	89.81	Meow, Meow, Meow.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_2	bUFsn9GQsCg_2-8-rgb_front	21.24	27.16	And they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats, they flee.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_3	bUFsn9GQsCg_3-8-rgb_front	27.29	29.05	The cats don't even have to chase them.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_4	bUFsn9GQsCg_4-8-rgb_front	31.57	41.85	And it's said that at Parker Center, downtown LA, their main center, are now going to enjoy having the Feral cats drive out the rats there.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_5	bUFsn9GQsCg_5-8-rgb_front	42.26	45.19	And you know, I think this should be carried out around the country.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_6	bUFsn9GQsCg_6-8-rgb_front	45.27	55.21	Wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the Feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise, I'm sorry to say, be euphemized.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_7	bUFsn9GQsCg_7-8-rgb_front	55.32	59.9	Now, from South Korea, we have another case of cats that's very interesting.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_8	bUFsn9GQsCg_8-8-rgb_front	60.02	62.6	They've just cloned glow-in-the-dark kitties.
bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg-8-rgb_front	bUFsn9GQsCg_9	bUFsn9GQsCg_9-8-rgb_front	62.7	69.51	Yes, they're giving them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultraviolet light.
bX0Zpf-rEgc	bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front	bX0Zpf-rEgc_1	bX0Zpf-rEgc_1-8-rgb_front	7.34	13.92	Tonight we're going to work and walk you through some advance bowling techniques so you can improve your game.
bX0Zpf-rEgc	bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front	bX0Zpf-rEgc_2	bX0Zpf-rEgc_2-8-rgb_front	14.32	17.88	From the stand point tonight we've covered a lot of information.
bX0Zpf-rEgc	bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front	bX0Zpf-rEgc_3	bX0Zpf-rEgc_3-8-rgb_front	18.64	31.57	We've talked basically about the stance, we've talked about how to move the ball through the stance, release position, spare shooting, how to change speed on the ball.
bX0Zpf-rEgc	bX0Zpf-rEgc-8-rgb_front	bX0Zpf-rEgc_4	bX0Zpf-rEgc_4-8-rgb_front	32.71	40.37	We've given you a lot of information from a stand point, now it's time to take the information go out on the lanes and play with it.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_0	bb1Z5dw4N-s_0-8-rgb_front	0.83	3.72	Now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_1	bb1Z5dw4N-s_1-8-rgb_front	3.79	9.26	The first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored, alright?
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_10	bb1Z5dw4N-s_10-8-rgb_front	95.43	107.04	And those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking, so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_11	bb1Z5dw4N-s_11-8-rgb_front	107.29	112.47	Know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_2	bb1Z5dw4N-s_2-8-rgb_front	12.05	20.68	And a lot of this has to do with structure, which I'm going to talk about in a minute, but you're thinking on your feet.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_3	bb1Z5dw4N-s_3-8-rgb_front	20.74	29.22	You know the topic, but you have to, while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation, you have to keep your audience interested.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_4	bb1Z5dw4N-s_4-8-rgb_front	29.44	38.53	You can't ramble on, you can't have random organizational patterns, you have to keep the audience with you.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_5	bb1Z5dw4N-s_5-8-rgb_front	40.38	45.64	So that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_6	bb1Z5dw4N-s_6-8-rgb_front	46.55	55.34	Obviously your goal, your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well, thought-out speech.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_7	bb1Z5dw4N-s_7-8-rgb_front	56.19	65.89	Well, you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech, you just met the topic.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_8	bb1Z5dw4N-s_8-8-rgb_front	66.12	72.69	So you have to try and present a well thought-out speech, but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time.
bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s-8-rgb_front	bb1Z5dw4N-s_9	bb1Z5dw4N-s_9-8-rgb_front	74.42	92.14	You also, one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research, you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech, so you're going to miss out on some of those details.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_0	bbSKqkE4EBs_0-8-rgb_front	0.66	5.39	In this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of Qigong breathing.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_1	bbSKqkE4EBs_1-8-rgb_front	5.48	21.85	The essence of all Qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath, and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular Qigong exercises we do, I like to talk more about the Western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_10	bbSKqkE4EBs_10-8-rgb_front	85.41	93.53	Will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing, that we'll talk about in the next segment.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_11	bbSKqkE4EBs_11-8-rgb_front	93.61	96.62	So remember, belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_2	bbSKqkE4EBs_2-8-rgb_front	21.93	26.31	One of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_3	bbSKqkE4EBs_3-8-rgb_front	26.4	30.06	The lymphatic system has two pumps.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_4	bbSKqkE4EBs_4-8-rgb_front	30.19	36.6	One we get through exercise, muscle contraction, and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm, the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_5	bbSKqkE4EBs_5-8-rgb_front	36.73	45.56	The dome shaped muscle that's here, right underneath our lungs, and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_6	bbSKqkE4EBs_6-8-rgb_front	45.69	55.81	That action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body, lymph being, I hate to say it, the gook of our body, or the waste products of many of our body's systems.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_7	bbSKqkE4EBs_7-8-rgb_front	56.08	61.49	So, one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_8	bbSKqkE4EBs_8-8-rgb_front	61.68	80.34	It has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the PH of our blood, which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis, and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way, the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that.
bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs-8-rgb_front	bbSKqkE4EBs_9	bbSKqkE4EBs_9-8-rgb_front	80.49	85.37	So, we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_0	bcNtUYh3GNs_0-8-rgb_front	2.53	10.68	I'm Veronyka Bass from Veronyka's Color Salon and Day Spa.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_2	bcNtUYh3GNs_2-8-rgb_front	10.79	13.17	Now we're going to have her lean back, get comfortable.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_3	bcNtUYh3GNs_3-8-rgb_front	13.42	15.69	And this is where we're going to use the warm water.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_4	bcNtUYh3GNs_4-8-rgb_front	15.71	19.86	More on the warm side than not hot or cold.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_5	bcNtUYh3GNs_5-8-rgb_front	20.25	42.34	So we're going to get ready to shampoo her, and at the very end of a shampoo, it's nice to give it a cold rinse, so it seals the cuticle.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_6	bcNtUYh3GNs_6-8-rgb_front	42.53	43.33	Alot of people don't realize that.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_7	bcNtUYh3GNs_7-8-rgb_front	43.39	49.11	It's going to be a little bit of a cold shower, but it seals the cuticle.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_8	bcNtUYh3GNs_8-8-rgb_front	49.52	53.21	Now I'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the pH balance down.
bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs-8-rgb_front	bcNtUYh3GNs_9	bcNtUYh3GNs_9-8-rgb_front	53.3	58.43	This will stop the total continuation of processing.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_1	bjvIIdYWc-k_1-8-rgb_front	4.47	9.54	Right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_2	bjvIIdYWc-k_2-8-rgb_front	9.87	13.01	What I have here in my hand is a paint wheel.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_3	bjvIIdYWc-k_3-8-rgb_front	13.17	16.91	It gives the different colors that independent stores would offer.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_4	bjvIIdYWc-k_4-8-rgb_front	18.2	20.02	So you can have specific selections to choose from.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_5	bjvIIdYWc-k_5-8-rgb_front	20.31	34.35	Depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat, a eggshell, a satin, gloss, semi-gloss, all that can be done regardless of your color chooses.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_6	bjvIIdYWc-k_6-8-rgb_front	34.91	46.33	Personally I would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_7	bjvIIdYWc-k_7-8-rgb_front	50.63	53.99	You can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_8	bjvIIdYWc-k_8-8-rgb_front	54.3	65.0	The reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors, the different textures and also the ability and clean ability.
bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k-8-rgb_front	bjvIIdYWc-k_9	bjvIIdYWc-k_9-8-rgb_front	65.1	71.79	A higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_1	bpOKSl0oIIw_1-8-rgb_front	3.47	7.54	Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_10	bpOKSl0oIIw_10-8-rgb_front	39.08	42.14	The sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_11	bpOKSl0oIIw_11-8-rgb_front	42.75	45.48	So we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_12	bpOKSl0oIIw_12-8-rgb_front	46.89	57.39	We look over here on our left, we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_13	bpOKSl0oIIw_13-8-rgb_front	57.46	66.44	What we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_14	bpOKSl0oIIw_14-8-rgb_front	66.58	75.33	But we need to be careful because, if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball, we will die.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_15	bpOKSl0oIIw_15-8-rgb_front	75.52	78.19	So we need to find a different way of doing things.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_2	bpOKSl0oIIw_2-8-rgb_front	7.6	9.28	A company with which I have no affiliation.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_3	bpOKSl0oIIw_3-8-rgb_front	9.5	10.25	All right!
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_4	bpOKSl0oIIw_4-8-rgb_front	10.83	13.24	Here we are in test chamber 08.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_5	bpOKSl0oIIw_5-8-rgb_front	13.8	15.9	We've got some new icons here now.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_6	bpOKSl0oIIw_6-8-rgb_front	16.16	25.11	We've got the old familiar power ball death, power ball power conduit, and now it looks like we've got some other ones.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_7	bpOKSl0oIIw_7-8-rgb_front	25.23	27.75	The risk of drowning and don't drink the water.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_8	bpOKSl0oIIw_8-8-rgb_front	27.87	35.6	So we look here in test chamber 08.
bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw-8-rgb_front	bpOKSl0oIIw_9	bpOKSl0oIIw_9-8-rgb_front	35.66	39.01	We can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_0	cDJuwtDYaSg_0-8-rgb_front	0.26	3.34	Alright the drink that we are about to make is a Black and Tan.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_1	cDJuwtDYaSg_1-8-rgb_front	3.37	7.45	Now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_10	cDJuwtDYaSg_10-8-rgb_front	53.65	62.62	So anytime you want to spice up your Guinness a little bit, and you don't feel like having just a Bask, make yourself a Black and Tan, a mixture of both.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_11	cDJuwtDYaSg_11-8-rgb_front	62.66	63.76	Bottoms up.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_2	cDJuwtDYaSg_2-8-rgb_front	7.93	14.5	But if you ask most people they'll tell you that Guinness and Bask Ale.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_3	cDJuwtDYaSg_3-8-rgb_front	14.61	21.43	First thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your Bask, half way.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_4	cDJuwtDYaSg_4-8-rgb_front	27.16	29.72	And we're going to fill it the rest of the way with Guinness.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_5	cDJuwtDYaSg_5-8-rgb_front	29.99	32.14	And the Guinness is darker.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_6	cDJuwtDYaSg_6-8-rgb_front	36.43	38.85	You will see the difference in the top and the bottom.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_7	cDJuwtDYaSg_7-8-rgb_front	39.01	48.58	It should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_8	cDJuwtDYaSg_8-8-rgb_front	48.86	52.13	And the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom.
cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg-8-rgb_front	cDJuwtDYaSg_9	cDJuwtDYaSg_9-8-rgb_front	52.46	53.56	And that's a Black and Tan.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_0	cHFW_U9e4sM_0-8-rgb_front	0.38	7.45	The next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_1	cHFW_U9e4sM_1-8-rgb_front	7.55	11.17	And this one is really easy to find, it's literally between the second and third toe.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_2	cHFW_U9e4sM_2-8-rgb_front	11.31	13.99	So you're just going to rub in between the toes.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_3	cHFW_U9e4sM_3-8-rgb_front	14.05	29.65	Just run your finger in there, massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain, relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners, they don't like them touched by the vets much, but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_4	cHFW_U9e4sM_4-8-rgb_front	29.83	32.67	You can do a full foot massage on them if you like.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_5	cHFW_U9e4sM_5-8-rgb_front	32.7	41.46	There's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well, but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_6	cHFW_U9e4sM_6-8-rgb_front	41.57	48.3	So you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_7	cHFW_U9e4sM_7-8-rgb_front	48.58	51.4	So you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_8	cHFW_U9e4sM_8-8-rgb_front	51.45	54.23	You want to work that point.
cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM-8-rgb_front	cHFW_U9e4sM_9	cHFW_U9e4sM_9-8-rgb_front	54.33	64.82	Again this is a massage, just rubbing that muscle between your fingers, the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard, feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_1	cOCnNdL5fwI_1-8-rgb_front	3.26	5.98	I'm here to discuss short curly locks with you.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_10	cOCnNdL5fwI_10-8-rgb_front	65.4	70.74	Now Heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_11	cOCnNdL5fwI_11-8-rgb_front	70.79	79.68	She's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_12	cOCnNdL5fwI_12-8-rgb_front	79.75	84.05	The courser your hair is, the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_13	cOCnNdL5fwI_13-8-rgb_front	84.94	96.55	Now if I grab this, the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_14	cOCnNdL5fwI_14-8-rgb_front	97.89	101.76	So you can see that the curl is very tight, very wiggly.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_15	cOCnNdL5fwI_15-8-rgb_front	101.86	108.37	That is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_16	cOCnNdL5fwI_16-8-rgb_front	108.42	118.31	It's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_2	cOCnNdL5fwI_2-8-rgb_front	6.64	15.19	The tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_3	cOCnNdL5fwI_3-8-rgb_front	15.4	24.15	"Curling irons come in various diameters they come very small, 1/2"" they go to 3/4"", the 1"" 1 1/2"" and then the 2""."
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_4	cOCnNdL5fwI_4-8-rgb_front	24.94	30.48	The longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_5	cOCnNdL5fwI_5-8-rgb_front	30.68	33.86	Now when somebody like Heather's hair, you also must take into consideration the length of her hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_6	cOCnNdL5fwI_6-8-rgb_front	33.93	48.38	If I was to use this on this section, it would only do one turn, it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_7	cOCnNdL5fwI_7-8-rgb_front	48.47	57.32	Just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out, the smaller diameter will work best on her hair.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_8	cOCnNdL5fwI_8-8-rgb_front	57.42	61.67	Another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it.
cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI-8-rgb_front	cOCnNdL5fwI_9	cOCnNdL5fwI_9-8-rgb_front	61.7	64.63	The heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_0	cS44xaCZy7A_0-8-rgb_front	0.98	3.72	We're now going to start lunging the horse.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_1	cS44xaCZy7A_1-8-rgb_front	3.81	7.36	You'll notice that I still have the chain over my horseâs nose.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_2	cS44xaCZy7A_2-8-rgb_front	7.89	9.74	This just gives me a little bit more control.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_3	cS44xaCZy7A_3-8-rgb_front	12.28	21.9	I also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he doesn't want to behave and stay on the circle.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_4	cS44xaCZy7A_4-8-rgb_front	23.25	27.09	It also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_5	cS44xaCZy7A_5-8-rgb_front	27.44	37.06	I also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also in an enclosed arena.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_6	cS44xaCZy7A_6-8-rgb_front	37.13	40.09	So that if something does go wrong he can't get out.
cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A-8-rgb_front	cS44xaCZy7A_7	cS44xaCZy7A_7-8-rgb_front	43.63	50.36	So I'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me.

cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_14	cw5evdziBB4_14-8-rgb_front	62.01	63.72	A little on the hip.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_15	cw5evdziBB4_15-8-rgb_front	66.74	67.63	On the hip?
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_16	cw5evdziBB4_16-8-rgb_front	67.74	69.03	Have you had a massage before?
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_17	cw5evdziBB4_17-8-rgb_front	69.2	69.81	No.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_18	cw5evdziBB4_18-8-rgb_front	70.02	70.72	No, okay great!
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_19	cw5evdziBB4_19-8-rgb_front	70.96	74.89	Is there any part of you body that you would like special attention paid to?
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_2	cw5evdziBB4_2-8-rgb_front	9.11	19.55	So in this case we're working with a massage table, other individuals if they're in chair or in a bed, you'll deal with that as it presents itself to you.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_20	cw5evdziBB4_20-8-rgb_front	76.92	84.79	A lot of stress right now, so I think just whatever that will help me relax.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_21	cw5evdziBB4_21-8-rgb_front	84.93	86.63	Great, we can do that.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_22	cw5evdziBB4_22-8-rgb_front	87.87	96.02	So after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable, then we're set to move on to the next segment.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_3	cw5evdziBB4_3-8-rgb_front	19.58	23.02	So Molinia do you care to demonstrate with me?
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_4	cw5evdziBB4_4-8-rgb_front	23.1	26.61	I'm going to first have you sit up, great!
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_5	cw5evdziBB4_5-8-rgb_front	27.03	33.13	So when the individual gets on the table, first we have them sit on the side.
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_6	cw5evdziBB4_6-8-rgb_front	33.7	35.26	Can you swing your legs around?
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_7	cw5evdziBB4_7-8-rgb_front	35.97	37.16	There you go!
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_8	cw5evdziBB4_8-8-rgb_front	37.3	42.78	So they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table, great!
cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4-8-rgb_front	cw5evdziBB4_9	cw5evdziBB4_9-8-rgb_front	42.91	49.82	Then, slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_0	cwLJfXFf9ks_0-8-rgb_front	1.44	5.34	The principles of Aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_1	cwLJfXFf9ks_1-8-rgb_front	6.79	9.73	It can be applied in your family with your spouse, with your kids.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_10	cwLJfXFf9ks_10-8-rgb_front	55.25	61.47	In that, that last technique, as Phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_11	cwLJfXFf9ks_11-8-rgb_front	61.47	63.19	We can see exactly what they are seeing.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_12	cwLJfXFf9ks_12-8-rgb_front	63.66	65.91	We can get a little different perspective.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_13	cwLJfXFf9ks_13-8-rgb_front	66.32	72.99	If we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_14	cwLJfXFf9ks_14-8-rgb_front	73.16	76.82	As he attacks just turn and go right in.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_15	cwLJfXFf9ks_15-8-rgb_front	77.88	79.84	Everything is blending and harmonizing.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_16	cwLJfXFf9ks_16-8-rgb_front	80.16	81.6	Some can be a little more direct.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_17	cwLJfXFf9ks_17-8-rgb_front	81.63	83.8	Others can just not connect with that energy.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_18	cwLJfXFf9ks_18-8-rgb_front	83.8	87.66	If it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_19	cwLJfXFf9ks_19-8-rgb_front	87.66	94.52	There are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and Aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_2	cwLJfXFf9ks_2-8-rgb_front	10.18	13.52	It can be applied at work with an irate boss or co-worker.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_3	cwLJfXFf9ks_3-8-rgb_front	13.52	15.53	It could be an upset driver.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_4	cwLJfXFf9ks_4-8-rgb_front	15.53	16.87	It could be somebody with road rage.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_5	cwLJfXFf9ks_5-8-rgb_front	17.19	23.43	We are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don't we just take a peek.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_6	cwLJfXFf9ks_6-8-rgb_front	23.48	33.41	For example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block, not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with Aikido it looks something like this.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_7	cwLJfXFf9ks_7-8-rgb_front	33.65	36.41	I'll show you.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_8	cwLJfXFf9ks_8-8-rgb_front	40.96	43.98	So that is one way, you can just let them go right by.
cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks-8-rgb_front	cwLJfXFf9ks_9	cwLJfXFf9ks_9-8-rgb_front	43.98	49.13	If you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_1	cxW8HFCWjlQ_1-8-rgb_front	9.9	22.36	This yogurt is a Bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy, it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_10	cxW8HFCWjlQ_10-8-rgb_front	95.94	100.64	I will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_11	cxW8HFCWjlQ_11-8-rgb_front	100.91	106.75	Yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the United States so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_2	cxW8HFCWjlQ_2-8-rgb_front	22.38	34.47	I would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in HEB.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_3	cxW8HFCWjlQ_3-8-rgb_front	34.54	48.68	You can usually find this at HEB but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 tablespoons to your hummus.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_4	cxW8HFCWjlQ_4-8-rgb_front	48.78	59.02	Not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_5	cxW8HFCWjlQ_5-8-rgb_front	59.46	70.97	A lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_6	cxW8HFCWjlQ_6-8-rgb_front	71.04	75.77	It's a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_7	cxW8HFCWjlQ_7-8-rgb_front	75.77	89.35	This yogurt as I said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_8	cxW8HFCWjlQ_8-8-rgb_front	89.4	93.87	This one right here is my favorite and I think it is whitemountainfoods.
cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ-8-rgb_front	cxW8HFCWjlQ_9	cxW8HFCWjlQ_9-8-rgb_front	93.89	95.9	com you can go and order this.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_0	dIIMHOX5AD8_0-8-rgb_front	0.89	10.35	Now that we've covered walking properly, lets work on focusing on One Point, so we're actually moving up the body as we go.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_1	dIIMHOX5AD8_1-8-rgb_front	10.47	20.19	One Point, if you could look, the center of mass, is going to be bellybutton, anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down, depending, so right about where this belt is.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_10	dIIMHOX5AD8_10-8-rgb_front	89.51	91.7	And we will continue on this subject, shortly thereafter.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_2	dIIMHOX5AD8_2-8-rgb_front	20.36	26.49	Now One Point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_3	dIIMHOX5AD8_3-8-rgb_front	32.53	38.76	One way of thinking of it is that, if you have somebody, it's tensile strength.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_4	dIIMHOX5AD8_4-8-rgb_front	39.44	52.15	And if you have somebody grab onto your arm, they're out to be a living, breathing connection, that, yes they're, it feels very strong, it feels like a fire hose.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_5	dIIMHOX5AD8_5-8-rgb_front	53.78	59.95	A fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_6	dIIMHOX5AD8_6-8-rgb_front	60.03	65.9	It's a living entity, and therefore, One Point is very much the same thing, it is a living entity.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_7	dIIMHOX5AD8_7-8-rgb_front	67.35	72.04	And you are looking for that constant relaxed, natural power of tensile strength.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_8	dIIMHOX5AD8_8-8-rgb_front	72.16	82.83	It's not muscular by any means, and it is certainly not structural, but there is, well I shouldn't say that, because there is an aspect of structural to it.
dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8-8-rgb_front	dIIMHOX5AD8_9	dIIMHOX5AD8_9-8-rgb_front	83.05	89.34	With correct structure, and correct relaxation, you build on tensile strength.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_0	dKumOzqVk3M_0-8-rgb_front	0.55	5.24	Hello, this is JB, I'm with Austin Homebrew Supply in Austin, Texas.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_1	dKumOzqVk3M_1-8-rgb_front	5.96	13.47	Talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_10	dKumOzqVk3M_10-8-rgb_front	86.71	88.58	Subsequently it's food grade.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_11	dKumOzqVk3M_11-8-rgb_front	88.26	100.54	In other words, there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_12	dKumOzqVk3M_12-8-rgb_front	99.18	99.48	So.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_13	dKumOzqVk3M_13-8-rgb_front	100.76	104.01	These guys are called food grade pumps.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_14	dKumOzqVk3M_14-8-rgb_front	104.15	116.87	They're made by a company called March, and these guys do a great job of moving hot, boiling wort or beer from point A to point B without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_15	dKumOzqVk3M_15-8-rgb_front	117.07	117.51	So.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_16	dKumOzqVk3M_16-8-rgb_front	117.52	121.79	Food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_2	dKumOzqVk3M_2-8-rgb_front	14.7	18.28	Or wine, or cider, or socky.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_3	dKumOzqVk3M_3-8-rgb_front	18.43	21.06	You got a lot of different things you can make here.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_4	dKumOzqVk3M_4-8-rgb_front	20.58	21.02	So.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_5	dKumOzqVk3M_5-8-rgb_front	21.79	39.7	One of the things you want to do at the end of, or during the process of either making beer, especially beer making, or even wine, is you need to rack or transfer, we had some strange terminology here, but, racking means to transfer from point A to point B.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_6	dKumOzqVk3M_6-8-rgb_front	40.22	54.46	So, especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another, especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_7	dKumOzqVk3M_7-8-rgb_front	54.71	59.3	Well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_8	dKumOzqVk3M_8-8-rgb_front	59.43	81.15	So, so, that being said, we carry food grade pumps that, the reason they're food grade is, there's a space between where the motor hosing is, the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between, so.
dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M-8-rgb_front	dKumOzqVk3M_9	dKumOzqVk3M_9-8-rgb_front	81.19	88.0	There's a complete difference between the motor, and where the actual liquid comes through.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_0	dQJyDM9pKR8_0-8-rgb_front	0.58	5.43	Effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_1	dQJyDM9pKR8_1-8-rgb_front	5.48	16.21	You can do it either with your hands, with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse, keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_2	dQJyDM9pKR8_2-8-rgb_front	16.42	27.32	Or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape, the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_3	dQJyDM9pKR8_3-8-rgb_front	27.61	34.5	That's actually a fairly safe stroke to use, either form of effleurage, horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_4	dQJyDM9pKR8_4-8-rgb_front	35.4	46.35	They don't find it to be too invasive, it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the, unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_5	dQJyDM9pKR8_5-8-rgb_front	46.9	54.88	So again I'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_6	dQJyDM9pKR8_6-8-rgb_front	60.21	61.26	And just petting them.
dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8-8-rgb_front	dQJyDM9pKR8_7	dQJyDM9pKR8_7-8-rgb_front	60.67	63.98	It's a nice gentle stroke, it helps them to relax.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_0	dWOtJxrH_Ww_0-8-rgb_front	0.65	5.16	I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_1	dWOtJxrH_Ww_1-8-rgb_front	5.22	16.43	Now, if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator, first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_10	dWOtJxrH_Ww_10-8-rgb_front	77.07	87.25	Recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees, depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products, particularly dairy products.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_11	dWOtJxrH_Ww_11-8-rgb_front	89.97	104.02	Then the other side here, on the freezer side, some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distributing ice properly, or your water's not coming out.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_12	dWOtJxrH_Ww_12-8-rgb_front	105.37	118.09	Now if water's not coming out, most of these are equipped with a filter, so in this case, this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filter, and it tells you when to replace it.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_13	dWOtJxrH_Ww_13-8-rgb_front	118.38	133.19	On the ice, occasionally, you may just need to come in here, where these are frost free freezers, this can actually warm up, or some of your ice melts together, and the agitating arm can actually get stuck.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_14	dWOtJxrH_Ww_14-8-rgb_front	133.3	135.58	So you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_15	dWOtJxrH_Ww_15-8-rgb_front	135.69	140.52	So I'm Tim Gipson, and that's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_2	dWOtJxrH_Ww_2-8-rgb_front	16.53	21.73	So you want to locate where that is, and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_3	dWOtJxrH_Ww_3-8-rgb_front	21.94	25.47	If it is popped, you want to make sure you reset it to the on position.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_4	dWOtJxrH_Ww_4-8-rgb_front	27.23	33.82	The next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_5	dWOtJxrH_Ww_5-8-rgb_front	33.93	35.96	So that's basically on the power.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_6	dWOtJxrH_Ww_6-8-rgb_front	37.76	49.16	Now, if you still are not, do not have power, you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point, because there could be something internal to the refrigerator.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_7	dWOtJxrH_Ww_7-8-rgb_front	49.26	61.51	Now this particular refrigerator, it has all electronic controls, so it has its own sensors, which really tell you what's going on.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_8	dWOtJxrH_Ww_8-8-rgb_front	61.8	71.83	This particular model, up here, if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough, you might check your temperature controls.
dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww-8-rgb_front	dWOtJxrH_Ww_9	dWOtJxrH_Ww_9-8-rgb_front	71.92	76.71	This particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_0	d_0dt3VdYCo_0-8-rgb_front	0.88	7.52	In tennis, a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized, that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_1	d_0dt3VdYCo_1-8-rgb_front	7.99	11.57	And the half volley is one of those shots.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_10	d_0dt3VdYCo_10-8-rgb_front	36.74	40.28	He's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_11	d_0dt3VdYCo_11-8-rgb_front	40.95	42.76	So it's just a way of taking a ball.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_12	d_0dt3VdYCo_12-8-rgb_front	42.85	43.59	You're not really doing much with it.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_13	d_0dt3VdYCo_13-8-rgb_front	43.68	45.87	You're just blocking it forward.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_14	d_0dt3VdYCo_14-8-rgb_front	45.9	48.86	Now, John McEnroe was a master of this shot.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_15	d_0dt3VdYCo_15-8-rgb_front	48.89	50.39	But you have to have it.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_16	d_0dt3VdYCo_16-8-rgb_front	50.55	58.45	It's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back, because if they volley it at your feet, you've just got to be able to block it right back.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_17	d_0dt3VdYCo_17-8-rgb_front	59.03	62.66	So what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_18	d_0dt3VdYCo_18-8-rgb_front	62.77	65.06	See how many in a row you can make.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_19	d_0dt3VdYCo_19-8-rgb_front	65.39	72.32	See how many out of 50 you can make, and as the number of balls in practice improves, your results on the court are also going to improve.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_2	d_0dt3VdYCo_2-8-rgb_front	11.62	12.07	So here's a drill that helps you get the half volley.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_3	d_0dt3VdYCo_3-8-rgb_front	12.12	14.1	You can use a wall, which is great.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_4	d_0dt3VdYCo_4-8-rgb_front	14.22	19.93	But, in this case, your practice partner, in this case it will be me, I'll be throwing the ball to Darren.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_5	d_0dt3VdYCo_5-8-rgb_front	19.98	29.11	So, imagine that you've hit a nice shot, you're coming to the net, or you've hit a nice serve, you're coming to the net, and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_6	d_0dt3VdYCo_6-8-rgb_front	29.19	33.0	It bounces up, and you've got to just block it forward.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_7	d_0dt3VdYCo_7-8-rgb_front	33.05	35.25	So that's what this drill is.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_8	d_0dt3VdYCo_8-8-rgb_front	32.66	33.8	So Darren is going to demonstrate.
d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo-8-rgb_front	d_0dt3VdYCo_9	d_0dt3VdYCo_9-8-rgb_front	35.38	36.63	I'm going to throw it by his feet.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_0	d_V_K6ziiNA_0-8-rgb_front	0.9	6.35	Knots have a long and varied history throughout time, and today I'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_1	d_V_K6ziiNA_1-8-rgb_front	6.43	10.14	My name is Robert Segundo, and I'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_10	d_V_K6ziiNA_10-8-rgb_front	47.8	49.99	I mean, you can hold things with it.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_11	d_V_K6ziiNA_11-8-rgb_front	50.1	52.79	You can't put a whole lot of tension on it,because it will slip through.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_12	d_V_K6ziiNA_12-8-rgb_front	53.03	55.56	But it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_13	d_V_K6ziiNA_13-8-rgb_front	55.65	57.08	Let's do that one more time.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_14	d_V_K6ziiNA_14-8-rgb_front	57.16	58.72	Let's pull this up...and out, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_15	d_V_K6ziiNA_15-8-rgb_front	59.6	65.77	Once again, we'll go over, we'll go under, over our standing end.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_16	d_V_K6ziiNA_16-8-rgb_front	66.82	71.65	And we'll go over like so, back under, and through the loop we've created, and there it is.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_17	d_V_K6ziiNA_17-8-rgb_front	72.68	75.2	There's our clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_18	d_V_K6ziiNA_18-8-rgb_front	75.24	80.15	My name is Robert Segundo, and enjoy tying knots.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_2	d_V_K6ziiNA_2-8-rgb_front	10.28	15.53	Now a hitch, technically, isn't a knot, but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_3	d_V_K6ziiNA_3-8-rgb_front	15.66	20.94	So what we're going to do is, we're going to look down to our table here, and we can see I have my rod, here, that I'm going to attach my line to.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_4	d_V_K6ziiNA_4-8-rgb_front	22.54	29.43	What I'm going to do is, I'm going to take my line initially, I'm going to roll it up and over, and then bring it under, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_5	d_V_K6ziiNA_5-8-rgb_front	29.54	32.66	Then it's going to go over the standing end that was there, and I'm going to take my working end back up and over.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_6	d_V_K6ziiNA_6-8-rgb_front	32.78	35.04	And it's going to come under, and then back through the loop, like so.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_7	d_V_K6ziiNA_7-8-rgb_front	39.6	39.97	There you go.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_8	d_V_K6ziiNA_8-8-rgb_front	40.14	46.78	This is basically two half-hitches put together, and this is just a clove hitch.
d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA-8-rgb_front	d_V_K6ziiNA_9	d_V_K6ziiNA_9-8-rgb_front	46.86	47.77	And it's really tight.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_0_1	eLv9Uhs89IQ_0_1-8-rgb_front	1.87	8.16	Hello, have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce? Well, I'm Dr. Felicia and I'd like to share a few tips with you.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_10	eLv9Uhs89IQ_10-8-rgb_front	67.13	74.9	If you have children, you need to prepare, if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools, get them registered.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_11	eLv9Uhs89IQ_11-8-rgb_front	75.27	78.74	You may need to actually enlist family support for child care.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_12	eLv9Uhs89IQ_12-8-rgb_front	78.88	90.33	You may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out, in terms of who keeps what, belongings and personal belongings in the house, who keeps what.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_13	eLv9Uhs89IQ_13-8-rgb_front	90.55	98.95	And if you are the caretaker of the children, you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_14	eLv9Uhs89IQ_14-8-rgb_front	99.38	100.18	In either case, I wish you good luck.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_15	eLv9Uhs89IQ_15-8-rgb_front	100.27	105.03	And remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_16	eLv9Uhs89IQ_16-8-rgb_front	105.85	108.37	Good luck, Dr. Felicia, goodbye.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_2	eLv9Uhs89IQ_2-8-rgb_front	8.21	15.7	Preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect, whether you're the male or the female in the relationship.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_3	eLv9Uhs89IQ_3-8-rgb_front	16.09	27.11	One of the things you want to consider, especially if you're the female is that for instance today, most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_4	eLv9Uhs89IQ_4-8-rgb_front	27.23	33.52	So, if the partner wanted to go back to school and be career-oriented, that's give them three years time in preparation.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_5	eLv9Uhs89IQ_5-8-rgb_front	33.66	36.82	So, that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_6	eLv9Uhs89IQ_6-8-rgb_front	36.93	48.41	If you already had a career and you're in a working world, it's not as quite as frightening, but, chances are your assets are pretty well divided, and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_7	eLv9Uhs89IQ_7-8-rgb_front	49.05	56.56	You want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive, it's not worth it.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_8	eLv9Uhs89IQ_8-8-rgb_front	56.68	63.27	You may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person's pay.
eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ-8-rgb_front	eLv9Uhs89IQ_9	eLv9Uhs89IQ_9-8-rgb_front	65.12	67.01	The other thing that you want to prepare for is housing.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_0	eRiOhdeskNE_0-8-rgb_front	0.55	2.39	Alright we've just completed our two flowers.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_1	eRiOhdeskNE_1-8-rgb_front	2.46	9.48	They've been clear embossed and then they've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a center for each of these flower.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_10	eRiOhdeskNE_10-8-rgb_front	43.15	46.18	And just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_11	eRiOhdeskNE_11-8-rgb_front	51.6	57.88	Alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_12	eRiOhdeskNE_12-8-rgb_front	57.49	57.64	Alright.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_13	eRiOhdeskNE_13-8-rgb_front	59.41	60.62	And then the little one same thing.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_14	eRiOhdeskNE_14-8-rgb_front	62.86	73.79	Alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so I'm going to need a smaller hole.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_15	eRiOhdeskNE_15-8-rgb_front	73.89	80.3	I need a 3/16th so I'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_16	eRiOhdeskNE_16-8-rgb_front	82.13	87.13	And I'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_17	eRiOhdeskNE_17-8-rgb_front	87.65	100.48	I chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that I've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see I've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_18	eRiOhdeskNE_18-8-rgb_front	100.62	113.82	I've attached them with the hemp twine and then I've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly Sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your Mom will be proud to hang on her front door.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_2	eRiOhdeskNE_2-8-rgb_front	9.5	17.93	And I'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and I'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_3	eRiOhdeskNE_3-8-rgb_front	18.77	21.97	Punch it out, and do the same thing with the smaller flower.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_4	eRiOhdeskNE_4-8-rgb_front	22.21	22.88	Punch that out.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_5	eRiOhdeskNE_5-8-rgb_front	25.36	27.7	And I'm going to be using the pewter eyelets.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_6	eRiOhdeskNE_6-8-rgb_front	27.87	29.24	And I'm just going to push down.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_7	eRiOhdeskNE_7-8-rgb_front	29.3	37.81	And sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_8	eRiOhdeskNE_8-8-rgb_front	40.3	41.44	There's one.
eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE-8-rgb_front	eRiOhdeskNE_9	eRiOhdeskNE_9-8-rgb_front	41.8	42.79	And now the second one.
eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front	eY32ru3Nstc_0	eY32ru3Nstc_0-8-rgb_front	0.43	5.89	I'm going to show you how to make a Razberi Sunsplash, a wonderfully fruity cocktail.
eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front	eY32ru3Nstc_1	eY32ru3Nstc_1-8-rgb_front	5.92	7.84	We are going to start off with our ice.
eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front	eY32ru3Nstc_10	eY32ru3Nstc_10-8-rgb_front	36.22	39.69	Then, we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine.
eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front	eY32ru3Nstc_11	eY32ru3Nstc_11-8-rgb_front	40.62	43.4	Uno, dos, like so.

eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc-8-rgb_front	eY32ru3Nstc_2	eY32ru3Nstc_2-8-rgb_front	7.56	8.48	Just like so.

f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_10	f-mvu_dZvjg_10-8-rgb_front	72.29	79.19	So, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_2	f-mvu_dZvjg_2-8-rgb_front	11.62	19.23	Alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well, so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_3	f-mvu_dZvjg_3-8-rgb_front	19.34	23.39	Like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_4	f-mvu_dZvjg_4-8-rgb_front	23.46	27.86	You never pet a dog when he is afraid, because that will make him more afraid.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_5	f-mvu_dZvjg_5-8-rgb_front	27.96	30.54	If it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_6	f-mvu_dZvjg_6-8-rgb_front	30.59	36.98	When he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle, that means he's happy, that's a normal state of mind.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_7	f-mvu_dZvjg_7-8-rgb_front	37.19	43.23	When the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this, your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_8	f-mvu_dZvjg_8-8-rgb_front	43.61	52.62	Another thing about dogs, when you're walking them, you'll see their ears perk up, if their ears perk up, that's them paying more attention.
f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg-8-rgb_front	f-mvu_dZvjg_9	f-mvu_dZvjg_9-8-rgb_front	55.64	72.19	But you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something, that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person, or another dog, or anything like that.

f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_1	f5EGPzGSCJs_1-8-rgb_front	3.91	8.84	Part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday.

f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_11	f5EGPzGSCJs_11-8-rgb_front	69.42	73.85	Another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_12	f5EGPzGSCJs_12-8-rgb_front	74.58	80.0	Aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_13	f5EGPzGSCJs_13-8-rgb_front	80.12	88.26	My name is Michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_2	f5EGPzGSCJs_2-8-rgb_front	8.91	17.7	When we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn, they're not in rough shape, they're not sitting at the bottom.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_3	f5EGPzGSCJs_3-8-rgb_front	18.01	20.97	Once you've been keeping your fish for a while, you're going to know if they're acting different.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_4	f5EGPzGSCJs_4-8-rgb_front	21.1	27.16	A common problem with fish is Ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_5	f5EGPzGSCJs_5-8-rgb_front	27.23	35.4	A lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality, temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_6	f5EGPzGSCJs_6-8-rgb_front	36.88	42.74	One thing that I like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.
f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs-8-rgb_front	f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9	f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9-8-rgb_front	42.81	63.23	We have MELAFIX and PEMEFIX. MELAFIX is an anti-bacterial and PEMEFIX is an anti-fungal. What I like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_1	fE6xxSbjVV8_1-8-rgb_front	10.17	22.79	If there is clay on here, what happens is, as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot, see if I don't keep cleaning that tool off, all it does is keep going round and round and round.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_10	fE6xxSbjVV8_10-8-rgb_front	62.78	65.01	Clean it off, you've got a lot of time.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_11	fE6xxSbjVV8_11-8-rgb_front	65.45	67.5	So you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_12	fE6xxSbjVV8_12-8-rgb_front	74.98	75.21	That's it.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_2	fE6xxSbjVV8_2-8-rgb_front	22.86	23.86	Sometimes it sticks to your pot, sometimes it doesn't.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_3	fE6xxSbjVV8_3-8-rgb_front	24.11	30.29	So when you get clay on your tool, any tool for that matter, clean it off, set it aside.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_4	fE6xxSbjVV8_4-8-rgb_front	30.39	48.11	So you start with a nice clean tool, so that as you take your tool, touch your piece, remember this is still kind of sticky, your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_5	fE6xxSbjVV8_5-8-rgb_front	48.22	50.28	You're trying to get it off of your pot.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_6	fE6xxSbjVV8_6-8-rgb_front	50.35	54.2	So we're going to come down in here again, clean some more of that off.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_7	fE6xxSbjVV8_7-8-rgb_front	54.29	55.94	See how you have that all down there?
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_8	fE6xxSbjVV8_8-8-rgb_front	56.03	57.35	You have to clean this off.
fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8-8-rgb_front	fE6xxSbjVV8_9	fE6xxSbjVV8_9-8-rgb_front	57.54	59.77	Sometimes you just get little pieces of clay.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_0	fslsm4MqBBE_0-8-rgb_front	0.42	3.84	Next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_1	fslsm4MqBBE_1-8-rgb_front	3.92	8.68	The edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_2	fslsm4MqBBE_2-8-rgb_front	8.85	22.22	Typically with the freestyle board it would have complete, wrap around, the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_3	fslsm4MqBBE_3-8-rgb_front	22.26	33.26	On a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_4	fslsm4MqBBE_4-8-rgb_front	33.35	49.63	The only other exception to the rule is the Magne-Traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice.
fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE-8-rgb_front	fslsm4MqBBE_5	fslsm4MqBBE_5-8-rgb_front	50.35	61.66	If you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_1	fux-zUwYX2Q_1-8-rgb_front	7.76	10.38	And now we're going to go over Fireball.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_10	fux-zUwYX2Q_10-8-rgb_front	58.72	65.31	But, you've also got to realize that that X divided evenly, rounded down amongst the number of targets.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_2	fux-zUwYX2Q_2-8-rgb_front	10.63	15.41	Fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_3	fux-zUwYX2Q_3-8-rgb_front	15.6	18.09	It is X and a red, much like Blaze.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_4	fux-zUwYX2Q_4-8-rgb_front	18.15	20.37	However, Fireball is a little different.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_5	fux-zUwYX2Q_5-8-rgb_front	20.81	28.92	Fireball is a Sorcery, but you may pay the X damage and have it deal to a single creature or play.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_6	fux-zUwYX2Q_6-8-rgb_front	29.06	37.09	However, Fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_7	fux-zUwYX2Q_7-8-rgb_front	37.28	42.29	So you would divide that damage evenly among the targets, but you also have to pay one additional colorless Mana for each additional target.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_8	fux-zUwYX2Q_8-8-rgb_front	48.54	57.75	So, if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red, and then you would start counting Mana for the X.
fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q-8-rgb_front	fux-zUwYX2Q_9	fux-zUwYX2Q_9-8-rgb_front	55.65	58.08	Likewise with two, three, and so forth.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_0_1	fyI1Ev5m1w4_0_1-8-rgb_front	1.25	12.28	Ok. Now let's talk about turning the compost pile. Well, if it's all good, and you put this pile together right, you don't have to turn the compost pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_10	fyI1Ev5m1w4_10-8-rgb_front	65.7	68.13	But we have plenty in the woods.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_11	fyI1Ev5m1w4_11-8-rgb_front	68.51	78.62	You would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_12	fyI1Ev5m1w4_12-8-rgb_front	78.72	82.18	And then you would start to turn your pile.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_13	fyI1Ev5m1w4_13-8-rgb_front	82.36	84.5	You would take the top and you would put it on the bottom, just like this.
fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4-8-rgb_front	fyI1Ev5m1w4_2	fyI1Ev5m1w4_2-8-rgb_front	13.09	22.36	Because, if you layered it right, and you watered it right, and you got your microorganisms in there, and you put the compost inoculate in there, you shouldn't have to turn this pile.
